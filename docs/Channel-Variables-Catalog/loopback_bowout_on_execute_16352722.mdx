## loopback_bowout_on_execute

boolean Set to `true` to have one-legged loopback channels "bow out" (remove the loopback legs) of the call.

`loopback_bowout_on_execute` is only useful to single leg calls. You never have to set it: `loopback_bowout` is `true` by default. It tries to remove loopback by doing [uuid\_bridge](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_commands_1966741.mdx#uuid_bridge).

When setting `loopback_bowout=false`, a bridged loopback call results in 4 legs (a-leg, loopback-a, loopback-b, b-leg).

When setting `loopback_bowout=true`, a bridged loopback call results in 2 legs (a-leg, b-leg).

During the call setup phase even with `loopback_bowout=true` there will always be 4 legs, however. loopback-a and loopback-b will be destroyed when a-leg and b-leg are successfully bridged.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="loopback_bowout_on_execute=true"/>
```
