## hangup_after_conference

boolean Controls what happens to a calling (A) party when in a conference and the conference ends (e.g. endconf flag set and moderator leaves). If `true` (default) the dialplan will stop processing and the A leg will be terminated. If `false` the dialplan continues to be processed after the end of conference.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="hangup_after_conference=false"/>
```

```xml
<!-- all regular members who dial "3500" will continue to the echo action after the "endconf" member below leaves conference -->
<!-- note that "hangup_after_true" is depenent on "endconf", one members (or more) must have endconf flag -->
<!-- if two or more managers join, call, participants will be kicked after laster member with "endconf" flag leaves -->
<!-- When a person calls into "3500-admin" and leaves, the participants who came in via "3500" will continue to their own echo app -->
