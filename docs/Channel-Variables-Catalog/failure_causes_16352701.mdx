## failure_causes

string Controls which failure causes will be considered as a failure to the bridge(s). This will change the values for which [continue\_on\_fail](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#continue_on_fail) will fail by default unless `continue_on_fail` is set to `true`.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="failure_causes=USER_BUSY,NO_ANSWER"/>
```

With SIP cause codes:

```xml
<action application="set" data="failure_causes=487"/>
```
