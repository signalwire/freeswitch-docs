## fail_on_single_reject

string This is useful when using the **`,`** AND operator in the `data` field of a bridge. The AND operator notifies a list of destinations, bridging to the first destination that accepts the call. Typically if a destination in the list rejects the call, the bridge will continue to be attempted until either another destination accepts the call, or a timeout occurs. See below for an example of using `fail_on_single_reject` with the **`|`** OR operator.

This variable allows one to terminate the bridging attempt on a single rejection of the call. This means the bridge attempt would fail, and if [continue\_on\_fail](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#continue_on_fail) has not been set, the call is terminated. This variable would be set within a condition before a bridge application. When used in conjunction with the `continue_on_fail` variable, one can perform operations such as rolling over a rejected caller to an answering machine application.

The default setting is `false`, meaning a single rejection will not terminate the bridging attempt.

It can also be set to a list of [failure causes](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table.mdx#about) to stop on, and can be negated to a list of causes not to stop on (i.e. stop on all other failure causes).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=true"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/$${profile}/$${kitchen}%$${domain},sofia/$${profile}/$${dining}%$${domain}"/>
<action application="javascript" data="answermachine.js"/>
```

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=USER_BUSY"/>
```

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!NORMAL_CIRCUIT_CONGESTION"/>
```

To use a list:

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=^^:CALL_REJECTED:NORMAL_CLEARING:USER_BUSY"/>
```

For negated list:

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!^^:ALLOTTED_TIMEOUT:NETWORK_OUT_OF_ORDER"/>
```

For use with the OR operator, consider the following example. Here the dialplan sends a call to multiple gateways simultaneously. In the case of `GATEWAY_DOWN` or `INVALID_GATEWAY` the bridge should not fail (i.e. negated `fail_on_single_reject`) and the dialplan should continue (i.e. `continue_on_fail`):

```xml
<action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=GATEWAY_DOWN,INVALID_GATEWAY"/>
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!^^:GATEWAY_DOWN:INVALID_GATEWAY"/>
<action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/gw1/$1|sofia/gateway/gw2/$1|sofia/gateway/gw3/$1"/>
```
