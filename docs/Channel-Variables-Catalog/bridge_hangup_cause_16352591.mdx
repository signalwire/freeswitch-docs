## bridge_hangup_cause

string This is set to the hangup cause of the last bridged B leg of the call. If you have `continue_on_fail=true` and `hangup_after_bridge=false` you can do checks on this to see what "really" happened to the call. You can for instance do execute\_extension after bridge, do a condition check on `${bridge_hangup_cause}` to see if it contains MEDIA\_TIMEOUT and then trigger a redial of the call or transfer to a cell phone. For a list of hangup causes, see [Hangup Causes](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="log" data="1 B-leg hangup cause: ${bridge_hangup_cause}"/>
```
