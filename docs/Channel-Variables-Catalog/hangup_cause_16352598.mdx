## hangup_cause

string This is set to the hangup cause of the A leg of the call (note that as such it doesn't make much sense before the end of the call). Often this will take the hangup cause from the B leg of the call, if there is one. For a list of hangup causes, see [Hangup Causes](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="log" data="1 A-leg hangup cause: ${hangup_cause}"/>
```
