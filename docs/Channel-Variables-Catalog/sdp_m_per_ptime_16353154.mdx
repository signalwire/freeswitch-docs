## sdp_m\_per_ptime

boolean Adds a new `m=` line for each distinct ptime in codec list.

When this variable is not set:

* When mixing codecs with various ptime in a codec list, they will now be allowed to co-exist in the sdp but it will send no ptime attr. This means the ptime preferences on the offer will be ignored when mixing codecs with various ptimes. When receiving a codec list with no ptime attr, the ptime will be chosen from local preference instead of assuming 20ms. This means if offer contains PCMU with no ptime and FS has PCMU@40i
* Dynamic payloads will now start at 98 and increment per additional dynamic codec per call. So now you can add CELT@32000h,CELT@48000h and each one will be auto-assigned a dynamic payload type.

Is now implied to be `true`, if you don't like this set it to `false` but it's going to be undefined behaviour. This basically means if you call in with ptime 30 then you have a bunch of ptime 20 codecs in your outbound list that there will be one m= line with 30 and the original inbound codec and more `m=` lines for each distinct ptime in your list. This is, of course, will depend on [disable\_transcoding](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#easy_dialstring) or [absolute\_codec\_string](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#absolute_codec_string) as well.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="sdp_m_per_ptime=true"/>
```
