## bridge_early_media

boolean By default this is false. Set to true, this makes the bridge use the live audio from the b-leg as ringback to the a-leg. Setting `bridge_early_media=true` means the early media will be buffered.

**Consider setting this to true if:**

* you are using a loopback channel to execute a bridge to an endpoint which sends back early media and the received early media's audio is degraded.

Note: The buffering resulting from setting `bridge_early_media=true` brings with it a higher resource cost than `bridge_early_media=false`, but may improve the sound quality of the early media. Set `bridge_early_media` before the bridge, or in the dial string for the bridge.

* you are using multiple targets in originate or bridge (e.g.: _originate \{globalVar=global}\[channelVar=channel1\]sofia/gateway/GW1/123456|\[channelVar=channel2\]sofia/gateway/GW2/123456)_ where you need to receive network generated Call Progress Tones (e.g.: ringtones and network announcements). You can combine this with `continue\_on\_fail` so you can fine-tune fallback on specific release causes only.
