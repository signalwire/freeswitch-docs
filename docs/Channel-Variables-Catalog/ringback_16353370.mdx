## ringback

string This addition lets you set artificial ringback on a channel that is waiting for an originated call to be answered. This will specify the audio to play to the A leg on unanswered aka (early media) calls.

Syntax: `<action application="set" data="ringback=[data]"/>`

Where `data` is either the full path (![(warning)](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) must be full path!) to an audio file or [teletone generation markup language](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod-dptools/gentones/TGML_6586573.mdx#lua).

You may also combine this with the [ring\_ready](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod-dptools/6586994.mdx#about) application. In this case the caller hears the normal ringback tone for a fraction of a second, then he hears the defined ringback media.

![(info)](/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) Since r15025 local ringback tone is generated only when there is no early media. To force local ringback despite early media use the [ignore\_early\_media](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#ignore_early_media) channel variable.

![(info)](/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) Ringback will not be sent unless the variable is set _and_ there's a ringing indication from the party that is being called. See [instant\_ringback](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#instant_ringback) if you want to fake ringback even when ringing indication hasn't been received yet.

**Usage**

Using the French ring tone defined in `vars.xml`:

```xml
<action application="set" data="ringback=${fr-ring}"/>
```

US ring tone:

```xml
<action application="set" data="ringback=%(2000,4000,440.0,480.0)"/>
```

You can send ringback after the call is answered:

```xml
def handler(uuid):
    session = PySession(uuid)
    session.answer()
    session.speak("Hello, connecting your call to the first available agent")
    session.execute("set","call_timeout=30")
    session.execute("set","continue_on_fail=true")
    session.execute("set","hangup_after_bridge=true")
    session.execute("set","ringback=%(2000,4000,440.0,480.0)")
    session.execute("bridge","sofia/foo/bar@test.com,sofia/foo/baz@test2.com:5070")
    session.speak("doh!")
```
