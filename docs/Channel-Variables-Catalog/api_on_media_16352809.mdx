## api_on_media

string Execute a [FreeSWITCH® API](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Introduction/FreeSWITCH-API.mdx) command when the far end sends media, i.e. ringing or 183/SDP.

  
The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use `export` or `export` with `nolocal:` prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>
```
