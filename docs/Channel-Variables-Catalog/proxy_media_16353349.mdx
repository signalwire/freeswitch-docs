## proxy_media

boolean Proxy Media mode puts Freeswitch in a "transparent proxy mode" for the RTP streams. The RTP streams still pass through freeswitch (unlike bypass media mode), however it is lighter on the CPU because freeswitch never even parses the packets or processes them in any way, it simply forwards them onwards.


**Usage**

![(info)](/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) [Late Negotiation](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Codecs-and-Media/Codec-Negotiation_2883752.mdx#about) () must be enabled in sip profile for this to work in the dialplan.

```xml
<action application="set" data="proxy_media=true"/>
```
