# SignalWire Voicemail Examples

## Introduction

In this guide, we will explore various examples of creating voicemail systems using different methods: SignalWire Markup Language (SWML), FreeSWITCH, and SignalWire Call Flow Builder. Each method offers unique capabilities and approaches to implementing voicemail functionality within telecommunication systems.

## FreeSWITCH Voicemail Example

## Introduction
In this setup, we'll configure FreeSWITCH to bridge incoming calls from SignalWire and a destination number. We'll start by registering a gateway with SignalWire SIP endpoint details, and establishing the connection between FreeSWITCH and SignalWire. Then, we'll configure the FreeSWITCH dialplan to handle incoming calls from SignalWire and forward them to a specified destination number. If the call is unanswered, we'll handle voicemail to ensure callers can leave a message. This setup enables seamless call forwarding and voicemail functionality using FreeSWITCH and SignalWire.

### Steps:

1. **Register a Gateway with SignalWire Endpoint**: Follow the guide provided by SignalWire to register a gateway with the SignalWire SIP endpoint details. This step establishes the connection between your FreeSWITCH instance and SignalWire.

3. **Configure Dialplan for Incoming Calls**: Once the gateway is registered, you need to configure your FreeSWITCH dialplan to handle incoming calls from SignalWire and route them to the appropriate destination.

```xml
 <extension name="incoming_calls">
   <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d{10})$">
     <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/your_signalwire_gateway/${destination_number}"/>
   </condition>
 </extension>
```

4. **Configure Voicemail Handling**: To handle cases where the FreeSWITCH user does not answer the call, you can set up voicemail handling in the dialplan.

```xml
 <extension name="voicemail">
   <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d{10})$">
     <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/your_signalwire_gateway/${destination_number}"/>
     <action application="voicemail" data="default ${destination_number}"/>
   </condition>
 </extension>
```

5. **Adjust Configuration**: Replace `your_signalwire_gateway` with the name of your registered SignalWire gateway.

6. **Testing**: After configuring the dialplan, test the setup by placing a call to the SignalWire number configured to forward calls to the SIP endpoint. If the call is not answered, it should be forwarded to voicemail as per the configured dialplan.

## SignalWire SWML Voicemail Example

### Introduction

In this guide, we will explore an example of using SignalWire Markup Language (SWML) to create a voicemail system. SignalWire Markup Language (SWML) is a scripting language used to control the behavior of voice calls, such as initiating calls, playing audio, recording messages, and more.

In this example, we will walk through the steps involved in setting up a voicemail system using SWML. This system allows callers to leave a message when the called party is unavailable to answer the call. We will break down each component of the SWML script, explaining its purpose and functionality, to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to create and customize a voicemail system using SignalWire.


#### Example SWML JSON script:
```json
{
  "sections": {
    "main": [
      {
        "connect": {
          "from": "+1XYXYXYXYX",
          "timeout": 10,
          "to": "+1XYXYXYXYX"
        }
      },
      {
        "switch": {
          "case": {
            "connected": ["hangup"]
          },
          "default": [
            {
              "switch": {
                "case": {
                  "noAnswer": [{"transfer": "zbPB5t-FP3ptWUbHmYHCm"}],

                "variable": "connect_failed_reason"
              }
            }
          ],
          "variable": "connect_result"
        }
      }
    ],
    "zbPB5t-FP3ptWUbHmYHCm": [
      {

        "record": {
          "beep": true,
          "format": "mp3",
          "stereo": true,
          "terminators": "#",
          "end_silence_timeout": 10,
          "initial_timeout": 10,
          "max_length": 60

## SignalWire Call Flow Builder Voicemail Example

## Introduction

In addition to traditional scripting methods like SignalWire Markup Language (SWML), SignalWire offers a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface called SignalWire Call Flow Builder. This intuitive tool allows users to create complex Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems visually, without extensive coding knowledge.

SignalWire Call Flow Builder empowers users to design IVRs by arranging various call flow elements such as connect, join_room, play, switch, etc., using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This approach streamlines the process of building telephony applications, enabling rapid development and iteration cycles.

Now, let's create an example of a voicemail system step-by-step using SignalWire Call Flow Builder, accompanied by screenshots to guide you through each stage of the process.
