# Raspberry Pi for FreeSWITCH Enterprise 

 

## About

There is no big difference in how to install, build or run FreeSWITCHâ„¢ on a Raspberry PI.

Please follow our [Debian for FreeSWITCH Enterprise](Linux/Debian_for_FreeSWITCH_Enterprise) instruction.

### Comments:

| The instructions above do not work with Raspbian Lite. A working script, in a pull request, is at:[https://freeswitch.org/stash/projects/FS/repos/freeswitch-contrib/browse/bmiller793/raspbianlite/pilitefs.sh?at=8df8aa0dc5d5ac44c7cc74e1274e9bff8d820c7f](https://freeswitch.org/stash/projects/FS/repos/freeswitch-contrib/browse/bmiller793/raspbianlite/pilitefs.sh?at=8df8aa0dc5d5ac44c7cc74e1274e9bff8d820c7f)You just need the rpilitefs.sh script, and you're good. It will install prerequisites, get source, build, and then install to /usr/local/freeswitch. Once it's done, you can start FreeSWITCH, and connect a phone to the default accounts.The script builds and installs for the minimum configuration. This, of course, can be easily changed to build the vanilla configuration, if you just want to let the Pi chug overnight. Yes, you can immediately connect VOIP clients to it at the default extensions of 1000-1019\. This has been tested with Linphone. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by bmiller793 at Apr 21, 2016 01:26 |

| Thank you very much for this. I have added you to the confluence-editors group if you would care to improve these instructions as your time allows. I think this is a great application for the RPi, myself.Thanks again. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at Apr 27, 2016 18:37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| One caution, however: the FreeSWITCH team can only permit links to their own repository or those of Debian and others that are trusted. If these updated instructions link to an untrusted source such as another developer's repo, then they won't allow it for security reasons. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at Apr 27, 2016 18:45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| I've created a bug indicating a few issues with the script. For the time being, I build from souce. ![(smile)](/images/icons/emoticons/smile.svg) ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by jungleboogie at Apr 28, 2016 15:51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Cool, thanks. Ultimately the core dev team hopes to use their build system to create packages that do most of what is needed to get an RPi up and running quickly. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at May 13, 2016 13:33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
