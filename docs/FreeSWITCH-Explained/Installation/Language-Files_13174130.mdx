## About

FreeSWITCH comes with a number of English sound files. Some of these are stand-alone sound prompts while others are used in mod\_conference, mod\_voicemail, and mod\_say\_en. All English sounds are listed in the FreeSWITCH source directory (src/docs/phrase/phrase\_en.xml).

## Languages

There are a number of sound file packages available. Not all are hosted by FreeSWITCH. We are trying to collate the locations of all of these files. If you know of sound files not on this list then please contact Andrey Volk (andrey@freeswitch.com).
