## Installing From Debian Packages

### Latest Release Branch:

**Release package**

```bash
TOKEN=YOURSIGNALWIRETOKEN

apt update && apt install -y curl
curl -sSL https://freeswitch.org/fsget | bash -s $TOKEN release install
```

FreeSWITCH™ is now installed and can be accessed with

**FreeSwitch CLI**

```bash
fs_cli -rRS
```

Dev Branch ("git"):

WARNING not suitable for production

**Master Test Package**

```bash
TOKEN=YOURSIGNALWIRETOKEN

apt update && apt install -y curl
curl -sSL https://freeswitch.org/fsget | bash -s $TOKEN prerelease install
```

### Building Debian Packages From Dev Branch

WARNING not suitable for production

The master branch depends on different libraries which are not available as packages in Debian distribution, but are available from FreeSWITCH repository. Thus, you will need internet access to the FreeSWITCH DEB repository.

**Build your own .deb Master package**

```bash
TOKEN=YOURSIGNALWIRETOKEN

apt update && apt install -y git curl
curl -sSL https://freeswitch.org/fsget | bash -s $TOKEN

cd /usr/src
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/stack -b master

curl -sSL https://freeswitch.org/fsdeb | bash -s -- -b 999 -o /usr/src/fsdebs/ -w /usr/src/stack
```

**Compiling from source code**

## Building From Source

### Compiling Release Branch (production)

**Release source build**

```bash
TOKEN=YOURSIGNALWIRETOKEN

apt update && apt install -y curl
curl -sSL https://freeswitch.org/fsget | bash -s $TOKEN
 
# Install dependencies required for the build
apt-get build-dep freeswitch
 
# then let's get the source. Use the -b flag to get a specific branch
cd /usr/src/
git clone -b release https://github.com/signalwire/stack.git
cd stack
 
# Because we're in a branch that will go through many rebases, it's
# better to set this one, or you'll get CONFLICTS when pulling (update).
git config pull.rebase true
 
# ... and do the build
./bootstrap.sh -j
./configure
make
make install
```

### Compiling Latest Dev (for testing)

WARNING not suitable for production

**Master source build**

```bash
TOKEN=YOURSIGNALWIRETOKEN

apt update && apt install -y curl
curl -sSL https://freeswitch.org/fsget | bash -s $TOKEN
 
# Install dependencies required for the build
apt-get build-dep freeswitch

# Then let's get the source. Use the -b flag to get a specific branch
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/stack.git
cd stack

# Because we're in a branch that will go through many rebases, it's
# better to set this one, or you'll get CONFLICTS when pulling (update).
git config pull.rebase true

# ... and do the build

# The -j argument spawns multiple threads to speed the build process, but causes trouble on some systems
./bootstrap.sh -j

# if you want to add or remove modules from the build, edit modules.conf
vi modules.conf

# add a module by removing '#' comment character at the beginning of the line
# remove a module by adding the '#' comment character at the beginning of the line 
# containing the name of the module to be skipped in the build process

./configure
make
make install

# Install audio files:
make cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install

# To update an installed build:
cd /usr/src/freeswitch
make current
```
