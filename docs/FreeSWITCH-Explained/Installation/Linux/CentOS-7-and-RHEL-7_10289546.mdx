## **Sofia-sip and SpanDSP Notice!**

SpanDSP and sofia-sip

Sofia-sip and SpanDSP dependencies have been removed from the FreeSWITCH™ tree since v1.10.4 Release (05 August 2020).

You can find source files of Sofia-sip here: <https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip>

SpanDSP sources are here: <https://github.com/freeswitch/spandsp>

Packages for Sofia-sip and SpandDSP are available for all supported platforms from our packaging repos.

You might have to visit each directory, run `./bootstrap.sh` then `./configure` then `make install`

## Installing from RPM Packages

**Easy Way**

### Release

FreeSWITCH™ can be installed from packages as follows

```bash
echo "signalwire" > /etc/yum/vars/signalwireusername
echo "TOKEN" > /etc/yum/vars/signalwiretoken
yum install -y https://$(< /etc/yum/vars/signalwireusername):$(< /etc/yum/vars/signalwiretoken)@freeswitch.signalwire.com/repo/yum/centos-release/freeswitch-release-repo-0-1.noarch.rpm epel-release
yum install -y freeswitch-config-vanilla freeswitch-lang-* freeswitch-sounds-*
systemctl enable freeswitch
```

FreeSWITCH™ is now installed and can be accessed with

**FreeSwitch CLI**

```bash
fs_cli -rRS
```

### Master for Testing

WARNING not suitable for production

The master branch of FreeSWITCH™ can be installed from packages as follows

```bash
echo "signalwire" > /etc/yum/vars/signalwireusername
echo "TOKEN" > /etc/yum/vars/signalwiretoken
yum install -y https://$(< /etc/yum/vars/signalwireusername):$(< /etc/yum/vars/signalwiretoken)@freeswitch.signalwire.com/repo/yum/centos-dev/freeswitch-dev-repo-0-1.noarch.rpm epel-release
```

And then install as follows

```bash
yum install -y freeswitch-config-vanilla freeswitch-lang-* freeswitch-sounds-*
systemctl enable freeswitch
```

**Compiling from source code**

## Building from source

### Release

FreeSWITCH™ can be built from source if you desire but it is not recommended.

In case of errors about "no usable spandsp" or sofia-sip, compile and install spandsp and sofia-sip first, then

`export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`

where `ls /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig` should list at least

`sofia-sip-ua.pc spandsp.pc`

Then FreeSWITCH should compile properly.

  
```bash
echo "signalwire" > /etc/yum/vars/signalwireusername
echo "TOKEN" > /etc/yum/vars/signalwiretoken
yum install -y https://$(< /etc/yum/vars/signalwireusername):$(< /etc/yum/vars/signalwiretoken)@freeswitch.signalwire.com/repo/yum/centos-release/freeswitch-release-repo-0-1.noarch.rpm epel-release
yum-builddep -y freeswitch
yum install -y yum-plugin-ovl centos-release-scl rpmdevtools yum-utils git
yum install -y devtoolset-4-gcc*

scl enable devtoolset-4 'bash'

cd /usr/local/src
git clone -b v1.10 https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch.git freeswitch
cd /usr/local/src/freeswitch
./bootstrap.sh -j

            --enable-core-odbc-support
make
make -j install
make -j cd-sounds-install
make -j cd-moh-install
```

## Building packages from source (Obsolete)

### Release

FreeSWITCH™ can be built from source as a packages if you desire but it is not recommended as we host the package builds already (see above)

That seems like a pretty simple fix.
