## About

Installation guidance for various linux distributions. The FreeSWITCH™ core development team has standardized on Debian and recommends it for all deployments.

Users who are familiar with other distributions are welcome to help the project [maintain these installation instructions](../index.mdx).

## **Sofia-sip and SpanDSP Notice!**

SpanDSP and sofia-sip

Sofia-sip and SpanDSP dependencies have been removed from the FreeSWITCH™ tree since v1.10.4 Release (05 August 2020).

You can find source files of Sofia-sip here: [https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip)

SpanDSP sources are here: [https://github.com/freeswitch/spandsp](https://github.com/freeswitch/spandsp)

Packages for Sofia-sip and SpandDSP are available for all supported platforms from our packaging repos.

You might have to visit each directory, run `./bootstrap.sh` then `./configure` then `make install`

  
We dropped support in packaging for anything older than Debian 9 and anything older than Centos 7 due to a number of dependency issues on older platforms.
