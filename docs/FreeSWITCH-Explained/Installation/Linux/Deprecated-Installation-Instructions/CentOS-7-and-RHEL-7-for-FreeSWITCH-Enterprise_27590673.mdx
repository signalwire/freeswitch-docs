## Installing from RPM Packages

**Easy Way**

### Release

FreeSWITCH™ can be installed from packages as follows

```bash
echo "USER" > /etc/yum/vars/fsausername
echo "PASS" > /etc/yum/vars/fsapassword
yum install -y https://$(< /etc/yum/vars/fsausername):$(< /etc/yum/vars/fsapassword)@fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/yum-stack/fsa/centos-release/signalwire-stack-release-repo-0-1.noarch.rpm epel-release

yum install -y freeswitch-config-vanilla freeswitch-lang-* freeswitch-sounds-*
systemctl enable freeswitch
```

FreeSWITCH™ is now installed and can be accessed with

**FreeSwitch CLI**

```bash
fs_cli -rRS
```

### Dev repo for Testing

WARNING not suitable for production

The master branch of FreeSWITCH™ can be installed from packages as follows

```bash
echo "USER" > /etc/yum/vars/fsausername
echo "PASS" > /etc/yum/vars/fsapassword
yum install -y https://$(< /etc/yum/vars/fsausername):$(< /etc/yum/vars/fsapassword)@fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/yum-stack/fsa/centos-dev/signalwire-stack-dev-repo-0-1.noarch.rpm epel-release
```

And then install as follows

```bash
yum install -y freeswitch-config-vanilla freeswitch-lang-* freeswitch-sounds-*
systemctl enable freeswitch
```

### Debug

FreeSWITCH™ Debug symbols can be installed with the following. Other package symbols are available also. Use **yum search &lt;package-name>** to find the symbols you want to install.

```bash
yum install -y yum-utils
yum install freeswitch-debuginfo
yum install sofia-sip-debuginfo.x86_64
ldconfig

```

Use the following example to install system debug symbols.

```bash
debuginfo-install glibc
ldconfig

```

Use yum info to see what repo the package was installed from

```bash
yum info spandsp

```

**Compiling from source code**

## Building from source

echo "USER" > /etc/yum/vars/fsausername
echo "PASS" > /etc/yum/vars/fsapassword
yum install -y https://$(< /etc/yum/vars/fsausername):$(< /etc/yum/vars/fsapassword)@fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/yum-stack/fsa/centos-release/signalwire-stack-release-repo-0-1.noarch.rpm epel-release
yum-builddep -y freeswitch
yum install -y yum-plugin-ovl centos-release-scl rpmdevtools yum-utils git
yum install -y devtoolset-7-gcc*

scl enable devtoolset-7 'bash'

cd /usr/local/src
git clone -b release https://github.com/signalwire/stack.git freeswitch
