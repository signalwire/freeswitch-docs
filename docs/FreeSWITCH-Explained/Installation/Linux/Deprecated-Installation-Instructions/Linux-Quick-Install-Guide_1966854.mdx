## Prerequisites

### Mandatory

These mandatory prerequisites provide for compiling the standard FreeSWITCH™ installation and test the supplied configuration and sample IVR. They are sufficient for many production systems.

* [**GIT**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) or [**WGET**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget)
* [**AUTOCONF**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconf)

* [**MAKE**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make%5F%28software%29)
* [**NCURSES-DEVEL**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses)

Optional

There are [optional modules](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Modules) that can be built and if so may require one or more of the following;

* [**curl-devel**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl%5F%28programming%5Flanguage%29) for [mod\_xml\_curl](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fxml%5Fcurl "Mod xml curl")
* [**expat-devel**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expat%5F%28XML%29)
* [**libtiff**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libtiff) for fax support
* [**libx11-devel**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%5FWindow%5FSystemf) for [Mod\_skypopen](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fskypopen "Mod skypopen")
* [**ODBC or UNIX-ODBC and ODBC-devel**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odbc) see the [ODBC page](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fspidermonkey%5Fodbc) for information
* [**OpenSSL**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openssl) (libssl-dev / openssl-devel) for [SIP SSL & TLS](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/SIP%5FTLS "SIP TLS") and [Dingaling](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Dingaling "Dingaling")
* [**python-devel**](http://www.python.org/) for the [python interface](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fpython "Mod python")
* [**ZLIB and ZLIB-devel**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib)
* [**libzrtp**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP) ZRTP encryption support, see the FreeSWITCH™  **ZRTP IS NOW DEPREICATED and will be removed out of the docs**

## Download

### Selecting a Version

There are two versions of FreeSWITCH™ to choose from: the _**stable**_ version recommended for production systems, and _**master**_containing the latest fixes and features used duringdevelopment. The stable version is recommended unless you have experience with FreeSWITCH™. Additional Information is located at [Source Options](https://confluence.freeswitch.org/display/FREESWITCH/Installation#Installation-SourceOptions).

This documentation is tested with the master version to keep it as recent as possible and to provide feedback to the developers. If there are problems the developers may request that you install the master version for diagnosis.

### Download Using Git Clone

Download FreeSWITCH™ by switching to the src directory and invoking one of the "git clone" commands below. The git command will create the **freeswitch** directory in src (/usr/local/src/freeswitch) and download the FreeSWITCH™ source files.

```xml
cd /usr/local/src
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch.git
```

---

## Generate Installation and Configuration Files

### Create Configuration Files

```xml
cd freeswitch    # <- the new freeswitch directory created by the git clone process
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
```

### Edit modules.conf

This is optional but consider [editing modules.conf](../../index.mdx#installation-methods).

  
---

## Compile the Source

```xml
make
```

  
---

## Install FreeSWITCH™

```xml
make all install cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install
```

---

## Start FreeSWITCH™

Make sure no other instance of FreeSWITCH™ or Asterisk is running on the same computer. Run command:

```xml
/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch
```

### Test a SIP Phone

Configure a SIP phone or softphone with the IP address of the FreeSWITCH™ computer and user "1000" and password "1234". The default FreeSWITCH™ configuration provides pre-defined definitions for extensions 1000-1019, all passwords are 1234.

* Dial 9664 to hear music.
* Dial 5000 to test the sample IVR
* Configure a second SIP phone as user 1001, dial 1001 from 1000, and 1000 from 1001 to test between phones
* Check out more in Configuring FreeSWITCH at [Some stuff to try out!](https://confluence.freeswitch.org/display/FREESWITCH/Configuring+FreeSWITCH#ConfiguringFreeSWITCH-Somestufftotryout!)

### Troubleshooting

* If there is no communication between the phones and FreeSWITCH™ or between phones disable the firewall on your Linux server. If testing is successful activate the firewall and open only the specific ports needed. For more information about firewalls and ports to open, see the [Firewall](../../../Networking/Firewall_1048908.mdx#about) page.
* If you suspect networking issues look into networking tools such as Wireshark or TCPDump.
