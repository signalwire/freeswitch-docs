# Ubuntu 14 Trusty 

 

  
**DEPRECATED** \- FreeSWITCH has not provided binary packages for Ubuntu since 2018, so the PPA's below are severely out of date. DO NOT USE.

## About

Ubuntu 14.04 packages are provided by FreeSWITCHâ„¢ in a deb repository as of version 1.6\. It is strongly recommended to use this repo as additional system libraries are updated as required.  

## Installing from Ubuntu Packages packages 

master branch (eg: "git"):

WARNING not suitable for production

```bash
wget -O - https://files.freeswitch.org/repo/ubuntu/freeswitch-unstable/freeswitch_archive_g0.pub | apt-key add -

echo "deb http://files.freeswitch.org/repo/ubuntu/freeswitch-unstable/ trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

# you may want to populate /etc/freeswitch at this point.
# if /etc/freeswitch does not exist, the standard vanilla configuration is deployed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y freeswitch-all

```

### Building Debian packages from master branch

WARNING not suitable for production

The master branch depends on video libraries which are not available as packages in Debian distribution, but are available from FreeSWITCH repository. Thus, you will need internet access to the FreeSWITCH DEB repository.  
This build process requires the use of the devscripts and cowbuilder packages. The cowbuilder package allows for creating the packages in a clean chrooted environment.

```bash
echo "deb http://files.freeswitch.org/repo/ubuntu/freeswitch-unstable/ trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

apt-get update

# we need some prepackaged libraries for video support from this repo
wget -O - https://files.freeswitch.org/repo/ubuntu/freeswitch-1.6/freeswitch_archive_g0.pub | apt-key add -

# if you have not already installed git and the devscripts packages please install them now
apt-get install devscripts git

# get the latest master. Use the -b flag to get a specific branch
mkdir /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
cd /usr/src/freeswitch-debs

git clone https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch.git freeswitch

cd freeswitch
./debian/util.sh build-all -aamd64 -ctrusty

# The build may last about an hour, depending on your CPU speed.
# If the build is successful, you will have a bunch of .deb files in /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
# please see the log files in /usr/src/freeswitch-debs/log/ folder to monitor the build or look for failures
```

Note that when installed from packages FreeSWITCH Packages use an FHS complaint directory layout. Binaries are installed in "/usr/bin/freeswitch", configs in "/etc/freeswitch", etc.
