**Easy Way**

## Installing From Debian Packages

### Latest Release Branch:

**Release package**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg2 wget lsb-release software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
USERNAME=FSAUSER
PASSWORD=FSAPASS
wget --http-user=$USERNAME --http-password=$PASSWORD -O - https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "machine fsa.freeswitch.com login $USERNAME password $PASSWORD" > /etc/apt/auth.conf
echo "deb https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` 1.8" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
echo "deb-src https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` 1.8" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

# you may want to populate /etc/freeswitch at this point.
# if /etc/freeswitch does not exist, the standard vanilla configuration is deployed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y freeswitch-meta-all
```

FreeSWITCH™ is now installed and can be accessed with

**FreeSwitch CLI**

```bash
fs_cli -rRS
```

Dev Branch ("git"):

WARNING not suitable for production

**Master Test Package**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg2 wget lsb-release software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
USERNAME=FSAUSER
PASSWORD=FSAPASS
wget --http-user=$USERNAME --http-password=$PASSWORD -O - https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "machine fsa.freeswitch.com login $USERNAME password $PASSWORD" > /etc/apt/auth.conf
echo "deb https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` unstable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
echo "deb-src https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` unstable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

# you may want to populate /etc/freeswitch at this point.
# if /etc/freeswitch does not exist, the standard vanilla configuration is deployed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y freeswitch-meta-all
```

### Building Debian Packages From Dev Branch

WARNING not suitable for production

The master branch depends on different libraries which are not available as packages in Debian distribution, but are available from FreeSWITCH repository. Thus, you will need internet access to the FreeSWITCH DEB repository.

**Build your own .deb Master package**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg2 wget lsb-release software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
USERNAME=FSAUSER
PASSWORD=FSAPASS
wget --http-user=$USERNAME --http-password=$PASSWORD -O - https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "machine fsa.freeswitch.com login $USERNAME password $PASSWORD" > /etc/apt/auth.conf
echo "deb https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` unstable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
echo "deb-src https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` unstable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
apt-get update && apt-get install -y xz-utils devscripts cowbuilder git screen

# get the latest master. Use the -b flag to get a specific branch
mkdir /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/stack.git /usr/src/freeswitch-debs/freeswitch

cd /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
# here it's good to run screen with logging, so that you can detach from the shell prompt
screen -L
cd freeswitch
./debian/util.sh build-all -aamd64 -c`lsb_release -sc`

# here you can detach by Ctrl-a Ctrl-d and see the log files in /usr/src/freeswitch-debs/log/ folder.
# The build may last about an hour, depending on your CPU speed.
# If the build is successful, you will have a bunch of .deb files in /usr/src/freeswitch-debs

**Compiling from source code**

## Building From Source

### Compiling Release Branch (production)

**Release source build**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg2 wget lsb-release software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
USERNAME=FSAUSER
PASSWORD=FSAPASS
wget --http-user=$USERNAME --http-password=$PASSWORD -O - https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "machine fsa.freeswitch.com login $USERNAME password $PASSWORD" > /etc/apt/auth.conf
echo "deb https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` 1.8" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
echo "deb-src https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa/ `lsb_release -sc` 1.8" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

apt-get update
 
# Install dependencies required for the build
apt-get build-dep freeswitch
 
# then let's get the source. Use the -b flag to get a specific branch
cd /usr/src/
git clone -b release https://github.com/signalwire/stack.git freeswitch
cd freeswitch
 
# Because we're in a branch that will go through many rebases, it's
# better to set this one, or you'll get CONFLICTS when pulling (update).
git config pull.rebase true
 
# ... and do the build
./bootstrap.sh -j
./configure
make
make install
```

vi modules.conf

# add a module by removing '#' comment character at the beginning of the line
# remove a module by adding the '#' comment character at the beginning of the line 
# containing the name of the module to be skipped in the build process

./configure
make
make install

# Install audio files:
make cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install

# To update an installed build:
cd /usr/src/freeswitch
make current
```
