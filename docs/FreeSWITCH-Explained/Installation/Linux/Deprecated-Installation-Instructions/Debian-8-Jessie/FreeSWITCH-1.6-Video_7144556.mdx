# FreeSWITCH 1.6 Video 

 

## THIS PAGE IS BEING RETIRED, USE [Debian 10 Buster (Obsolete)](../25460805.mdx#about) INSTEAD. MOST OF THESE STEPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE PACKAGES.
  
  
## About

Detailed information on how to properly build and test the new FreeSWITCH™ 1.6 with awesome video conferencing support.

## Introduction

FreeSWITCH™ 1.6 introduces new video features. See a working demonstration on the [VoIP User Conference 539](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mLik6RzeZk&t=13m11s) of 1 May, 2015 putting the FreeSWITCH™ video conference through its paces.

## What's new

FreeSWITCH™ now features video transcoding.

A few new modules were added with video codec support, such as mod\_av, mod\_vlc, mod\_vpx, and others. Based on that, mod\_conference can now do a video MCU, which introduces the new video layouts and group layouts. The video layouts feature allows you to set specific locations for the videos participants, floor holder and presenter.

Because FreeSWITCH™ core now supports video, you can do playback and record with video support, so you can do things like 'record' and stream to a live YouTube event over RTMP, etc. Also, mod\_verto now adds the ability to select video settings like resolution, bandwidth, camera selection and desktop sharing, all these features are demonstrated in the Verto HTML Demo page.

For more info, check out [mod\_conference](../../../../Modules/mod_conference_3965534.mdx#list) page. Let's get all these new features configured!

  
Installation

### Setting up the repos

[Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/) is required for this setup. A clean installation would make things easier and if you just follow the following steps everything will work smoothly.

A new set of dependencies was added to support the new features. Some of these dependencies were developed by the FreeSWITCH™ core team and the packages were added to our repository.

Let's configure the Jessie repo:

Double click to select all commands, then copy and paste in your shell session.

**Enable Debian Jessie repository**

```bash
echo "deb http://files.freeswitch.org/repo/deb/freeswitch-1.6/ jessie main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
wget -O - http://files.freeswitch.org/repo/deb/freeswitch-1.6/key.gpg |apt-key add -
apt-get update
```

### Get FreeSWITCH

Choose from the packages listed to complete your FreeSWITCH™ installation.

apt-cache search freeswitch | less

We suggest that you install the Vanilla meta package to get a basic running installation.

apt-get install freeswitch-all

If you desire other FreeSWITCH modules, run the `apt-cache search` command above and choose from those listed by running `apt-get install <module_name>`

You might get systemd errors. Replace freeswitch.service in /lib/systemd/system/ with this in that case:

**freeswitch.service Unit File for FS Package**

```xml
[Unit]
Description=freeswitch
After=syslog.target network.target local-fs.target

[Service]
; service
Type=forking
PIDFile=/run/freeswitch/freeswitch.pid
PermissionsStartOnly=true
ExecStart=/usr/bin/freeswitch -u freeswitch -g freeswitch -ncwait -nonat -rp
TimeoutSec=45s
Restart=on-failure
; exec
WorkingDirectory=/usr/bin
User=root
Group=daemon
LimitCORE=infinity
LimitNOFILE=100000
LimitNPROC=60000
;LimitSTACK=240
LimitRTPRIO=infinity
LimitRTTIME=7000000
IOSchedulingClass=realtime
IOSchedulingPriority=2
CPUSchedulingPolicy=rr
CPUSchedulingPriority=89
UMask=0007

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After that do:

```xml
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start freeswitch
```

The packages might not set up the configuration in /etc/freeswitch, you then can copy the files manually:

cp -a /usr/share/freeswitch/conf/vanilla /etc/freeswitch

Installing from Source

Now that we have our repo configured, let's install the deps:

**Dependencies**

```bash
apt-get install -y --force-yes freeswitch-video-deps-most
```

### Compiling

With all the dependencies installed, we can now properly build FreeSWITCH™ 1.6:

**Checkout FreeSWITCH source**

```bash
# because we're in a branch that will go through many rebases it's
# better to set this one, or you'll get CONFLICTS when pulling (update)
git config --global pull.rebase true

# then let's get the source
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://freeswitch.org/stash/scm/fs/freeswitch.git freeswitch.git
cd freeswitch.git
./bootstrap.sh -j
./configure
```

Enable mod\_av:

**Enabling optional modules**

```bash
perl -i -pe 's/#applications\/mod_av/applications\/mod_av/g' modules.conf
```

  
Let's make and install the project:

**Compiling the code**

```bash
make
make install
make cd-sounds-install
make cd-moh-install
make samples
```

## Configuring

### Certificates

It's mandatory that you use valid certificates on this setup. If you're setting up your own CA we can't guarantee that it'll work and we can't help you.

You can set up your certs at [http://www.startssl.com/](http://www.startssl.com/) .

Let's create our directory to store the certificates that will be used by FreeSWITCH™ and Apache:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/
```

After creating the certs dir, we need to set our wss.pem, agent.pem and cafile.pem:

**Certs files**

```bash
# NOT NEEDED if you will use following section on SELF SIGNED certificates

/usr/local/freeswitch/certs/wss.pem # CERT, KEY AND CHAIN files separated by \n
/usr/local/freeswitch/certs/agent.pem # CERT file AND key file separated by \n
/usr/local/freeswitch/certs/cafile.pem # CHAIN file or root CA
```

Make sure you generate those files with proper layout, as described above, otherwise you'll get WS SETUP FAILED messages in FreeSWITCH™ console and things won't work.

## Self-signed certificates  

If you really really want to use your own self-signed certificates, knowing that we will not support it, follow these steps:

**Certs files**

```bash
# Create certificates:

export DOMAIN=self.bkw.org
wget http://files.freeswitch.org/downloads/ssl.ca-0.1.tar.gz
tar zxfv ssl.ca-0.1.tar.gz
cd ssl.ca-0.1/
perl -i -pe 's/md5/sha256/g' *.sh
perl -i -pe 's/1024/4096/g' *.sh
./new-root-ca.sh
./new-server-cert.sh $DOMAIN
./sign-server-cert.sh $DOMAIN
mkdir /usr/local/freeswitch/certs
cat $DOMAIN.crt $DOMAIN.key > /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/wss.pem

# Setup Sofia TLS:

cat $DOMAIN.crt $DOMAIN.key > /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/agent.pem
cat ca.crt > /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/cafile.pem

 
# vars.xml:

<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="internal_ssl_enable=true"/>
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_ssl_enable=true"/>

# Restart FreeSWITCH.

## Now make sure your system has ca.crt imported so it will trust your new found hotness.

 
# Setup Apache:

# default-ssl:

SSLCertificateFile /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/wss.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/wss.pem
SSLCertificateChainFile /usr/local/freeswitch/certs/wss.pem

 
# TEST:

openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:443
openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:5061
openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:5081
openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:8082


# Depending on what you've setup you'll see:

subject=/C=US/ST=Oklahoma/L=McAlester/O=Tonka Truck/OU=Secure Web Server/CN=self.bkw.org/emailAddress=brian@bkw.org
issuer=/C=US/ST=Oklahoma/L=McAlester/O=Whizzzzzzy Bang Bang/OU=Certification Services Division/CN=WBB Root CA/emailAddress=brian@bkw.org

# Or there abouts.

# IMPORT THE CA.CRT CERTIFICATE INTO BROWSER !
# BE SURE YOU SET "domain" to self.bkw.org in vars.xml !
```

## WS SETUP FAILED with Self-signed certificates  

You cannot login, and FreeSWITCH is reporting (in debug) WS SETUP FAILED : this is because you have not imported your new self-signed certification authority in the browser. It will fail forever.  
Import the self signed CA in browser, or visit with the browser the same address and port you will use as wss. Eg: if you have wss://192.168.1.34 then visit from same browser [https://192.168.1.34](https://192.168.1.34) , then accept the certificate.

This (accept the certificate from https) is not the optimal solution, and can bring problems and failures to connect.

Optimal solution is to import into your browser your self signed Certification Authority.

  
Apache with SSL

Note that the HTML does not have to be served from the FreeSWITCH server, it can come from anywhere – the only requirement is that the SSL certificates on the FreeSWITCH server must be trusted.

Enable required Apache modules:

**Apache Required Modules**

```bash
a2enmod ssl
a2enmod rewrite
a2ensite default-ssl
```

Copy the CHAIN, CERT and KEY files to /etc/ssl/private:

**Copy cert files to /etc/ssl/private**

```bash
# NOT NEEDED if you made previous section SELF SIGNED certificates

cp chain.pem /etc/ssl/private/chain.pem
cp cert.pem /etc/ssl/private/cert.pem
cp key.pem /etc/ssl/private/key.pem
```

Setup Apache default SSL enabled host:

**Apache SSL Configuration**

```bash
# NOT NEEDED if you made previous section SELF SIGNED certificates

perl -i -pe 's/SSLCertificateFile.*/SSLCertificateFile \/etc\/ssl\/private\/cert.pem/g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
perl -i -pe 's/SSLCertificateKeyFile.*/SSLCertificateKeyFile \/etc\/ssl\/private\/key.pem/g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
perl -i -pe 's/#SSLCertificateChainFile.*/SSLCertificateChainFile \/etc\/ssl\/private\/chain.pem/g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf

```

Rewrite HTTP to HTTPS access:

**Rewrite HTTP to HTTPS**

```bash
perl -i -pe 's/AllowOverride None/AllowOverride All/g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
printf "RewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %%{SERVER_PORT} 80\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://MY.DOMAIN.NAME/\$1 [R,L]" > /var/www/html/.htaccess
printf "\n\nRewriteCond %%{SERVER_PORT} 443\nRewriteRule ^$ https://MY.DOMAIN.NAME/verto [R,L]" >> /var/www/html/.htaccess
```

Make sure to replace MY.DOMAIN.NAME with your FQDN in the commands above.

Improving Apache SSL Security settings:

**Apache SSL Tweaks**

```bash
perl -i -pe 's/ServerSignature On/ServerSignature Off/g' /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf
perl -i -pe 's/ServerTokens OS/ServerTokens Prod/g' /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf
perl -i -pe 's/SSLProtocol(.*)/SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3/g' /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf
perl -i -pe 's/SSLCipherSuite(.*)/SSLCipherSuite AES128+EECDH:AES128+EDH/g' /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf
perl -i -pe 's/#SSLHonorCipherOrder on/SSLHonorCipherOrder on/g' /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf
```

Now restart Apache to reflect the new settings:

```bash
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

## Test Certificates

You can use the following script to test your certificate setup. Create a file called test\_tls.sh and paste this content:

**Test TLS domain**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
 
DOMAIN=MY.DOMAIN.NAME
 
echo 'x' | openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:443 > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	echo "$DOMAIN:443 TLS FAILED!"
fi
echo 'x' | openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:5061 > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	echo "$DOMAIN:5061 TLS FAILED!"
fi
echo 'x' | openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:5081 > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	echo "$DOMAIN:5081 TLS FAILED!"
fi
echo 'x' | openssl s_client -connect $DOMAIN:8082 > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	echo "$DOMAIN:8082 TLS FAILED!"
fi
```

Then you can run the script:

```xml
chmod +x test_tls.sh
./test_tls.sh
```

If one of the above tests fail you MUST stop now and try to fix the issue before continuing this guide.

### Demo Files

Verto demo pages uses some videos to demonstrate the new video features. Let's get this environment set up:

```xml
ln -s /usr/src/freeswitch.git/html5/verto/video_demo /var/www/html/verto
mkdir -p /var/www/html/sounds/

```

  
Dialplan:

```xml
cp -f /usr/src/freeswitch.git/html5/verto/video_demo/dp/dp.xml /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/dialplan/default/0000_dp.xml
fs_cli -x 'reloadxml'
```

FreeSWITCH™ default dialplan checks if you're using the default password and warns you in the console about this security role, this extensions has an sleep of 10 seconds. Let's disable this for now so we don't have to wait 10 seconds each time we make a test call:

```xml
perl -i -pe 's/default_password/disabled_default_password_checking/g' /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/dialplan/default.xml
```

The proper way to fix this is by changing your default password to something more secure. Change it ASAP.

  
## Bridging from WebRTC (mod_verto) to PSTN/ITSPs

WebRTC is slow to establish media. So we need to provide SDP asap.

We can do this by answering and sending some silent packets, instead of waiting for normal call setup:

Dialplan:

```xml
<extension name="itsp_send_call">
<condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d+)$">
<action application="answer"/>
<action application="playback" data="silence_stream://2000"/>
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=333444555"/>
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_name=ciaociaociao"/>
<action application="bridge" data="{absolute_codec_string=pcmu}sofia/gateway/itsp/$1"/>
</condition>
</extension>
```

  
## Starting FreeSWITCH

The default and preferred init system on Debian 8 (and CentOS 7) is Systemd. If you didn't revert to system V and you're compiling Freeswitch like you are, the building mechanism now recognises that you're using a Systemd based distribution and it will offer you a script that will create the required user and group and install the Systemd files, so you can just start Freeswitch. You can install it using:

```xml
build/startup/install_systemd.sh
```

If this works out for you, you can skip the following two sections (about owners/permissions and Systemd).

### Set Owner and Permissions

Because you most likely built FreeSWITCH™ as root you must now create the user 'freeswitch' in group 'freeswitch' and change the FS files to owner = freeswitch and group = freeswitch and set the file mode appropriately. Execute the following commands as user root:

  
**Set owner and permissions**

```bash
# create user 'freeswitch'
# add it to group 'freeswitch'
# change owner and group of the freeswitch installation
cd /usr/local
groupadd freeswitch
adduser --disabled-password  --quiet --system --home /usr/local/freeswitch --gecos "FreeSWITCH open source softswitch" --ingroup freeswitch freeswitch
chown -R freeswitch:freeswitch /usr/local/freeswitch/ 
chmod -R ug=rwX,o= /usr/local/freeswitch/
chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/*
```

  
### systemd

systemd is the replacement service management system that replaces System V init. It is quite thorough and requires much simpler configuration scripts called **Unit Files**. systemd can start FreeSWITCH™ at boot time, monitor the application, restart it if it fails, and take other useful actions.

At the time of this writing (August 2015) the optimum systemd unit file is not certain, but the following have been proven to work on Debian 8.1 systems. If you have discovered a better approach, please update this section or submit a JIRA ticket so that we can capture this knowledge for the community. If you prefer to use the old sysvinit system, then use the instructions on the Debian 7 page.

The systemd unit file you're going to use should be something similar to this, this works fine when Freeswitch is installed using the methods above. The pre-compiled packages come with their own systemd files and scripts to install them, although you may certainly use this as a guide if you have trouble; but be sure to observe the correct file locations as they differ between compiled installations and package installations.

When troubleshooting systemd difficulties look for messages in `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/daemon.log` and grep for freeswitch messages.

The unit file start Freeswitch as root, so Freeswitch can setup priority, create some directories if needed, etc. Then it will continue running as user/group Freeswitch.

**systemd unit file FreeSWITCH built from MASTER**

```bash
; This file in installations built from Master can be found in 
; /usr/src/freeswitch.git/debian
; or
; /usr/src/freeswitch/debian
[Unit]
Description=freeswitch
After=syslog.target network.target local-fs.target

[Service]
; service
Type=forking
PIDFile=/usr/local/freeswitch/run/freeswitch.pid
PermissionsStartOnly=true
ExecStart=/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch -u freeswitch -g freeswitch -ncwait -nonat -rp
TimeoutSec=45s
Restart=on-failure
; exec
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/freeswitch/bin
User=root
Group=daemon
LimitCORE=infinity
LimitNOFILE=100000
LimitNPROC=60000
;LimitSTACK=240
LimitRTPRIO=infinity
LimitRTTIME=7000000
IOSchedulingClass=realtime
IOSchedulingPriority=2
CPUSchedulingPolicy=rr
CPUSchedulingPriority=89
UMask=0007

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

  
Now that the systemd unit file has been set up, you can copy it to the /etc/systemd/system directory where systemd looks for local customized files that won't be overwritten by systemd updates. Linking is possible to, but will give you issues when enabling (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=955379)

cp /usr/src/freeswitch.git/debian/freeswitch-systemd.freeswitch.service /etc/systemd/system/freeswitch.service

Next, notify systemd to look for changes in its configuration:

systemctl daemon-reload

Now you are ready to start FreeSWITCH for the first time. Because FS is owned by user freeswitch it should create its databases and log files under that user (instead of root) so that those files will still be accessible to it under future runs.

systemctl start freeswitch

To stop FreeSWITCH:

systemctl stop freeswitch

To install FreeSWITCH to start at boot time:

systemctl enable freeswitch

## Testing Video

At this time you have a fully functional FreeSWITCH™ 1.6 demo system. You can now point your RTC-enabled browser to [https://MY.DOMAIN.NAME/verto](https://MY.DOMAIN.NAME/verto) and you'll see the Verto Demo Page.

You can call for example extension 3500 to enter your first video conference. This is a conference with the video-mcu-stereo profile, that has the video features enabled by default.

After dialing to the conference, you'll hear that you are the only person in the conference and your video will appear on the screen:

![](/attachments/7144556/7471125.png)

When you place your mouse closer to 'Outbound Call' you'll see your user controls:

![](/attachments/7144556/7471126.png)

Now you can invite another caller and your video will be mixed together with the other caller video, and both video swill appear on the screen. The video disposition will behave according to the layout that was configured for this conference room.

FreeSWITCH™ 1.6 has a few layouts configured by default and you can change the video layout on the fly using the conference API, for example:

**Video Layouts**

```xml
freeswitch@internal> conference 3200-my.domain vid-layout
[      1up_top_left+5]	[      1up_top_left+7]	[      1up_top_left+9]	[                 1x1]
[                 1x2]	[        2up_bottom+8]	[        2up_middle+8]	[           2up_top+8]
[                 2x1]	[                 2x2]	[               3up+4]	[               3up+9]
[                 3x3]	[                 4x4]	[                 5x5]	[                 6x6]
[                 8x8]	[            overlaps]	[presenter-dual-horizontal]	[presenter-dual-vertical]
[presenter-overlap-large-bot-right]	[presenter-overlap-large-top-right]	[presenter-overlap-small-bot-right]	[presenter-overlap-small-top-right]


freeswitch@internal> conference 3200-video.evolux.net.br vid-layout 3up+4
Change to layout [3up+4]
freeswitch@internal>
```

  
## Conference

All the new APIs and variables of FreeSWITCH™ 1.6 are already documented on [mod\_conference](../../../../Modules/mod_conference_3965534.mdx#list) page. 

### Layouts

#### Definition

With video layouts you can configure specific video locations for your conference members, video floor holder and presenter. FreeSWITCH™ ships with many pre-defined examples and so you can start using the layouts right now.

For more information on how layouts work, check the [mod\_conference](../../../../Modules/mod_conference_3965534.mdx#list) documentation about [Custom Conference Layouts](../../../../Conference/index.mdx).
