### Building Ubuntu packages from master branch

WARNING not suitable for production

The master branch depends on video libraries which are not available as packages in Debian distribution, but are available from FreeSWITCH repository. Thus, you will need internet access to the FreeSWITCH DEB repository.  
This build process requires the use of the devscripts and cowbuilder packages. The cowbuilder package allows for creating the packages in a clean chrooted environment.

```bash
echo "deb http://files.freeswitch.org/repo/ubuntu-1604/freeswitch-unstable/ xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

apt-get update 
# we need some prepackaged libraries for video support from this repo
wget -O - https://files.freeswitch.org/repo/ubuntu/ubuntu-1604/freeswitch_archive_g0.pub | apt-key add -

#if you have not already installed git, devscripts, and cowbuilder packages please install those now
apt-get install git devscripts cowbuilder

# get the latest master. Use the -b flag to get a specific branch
mkdir /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
cd /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch.git freeswitch

cd freeswitch
./debian/util.sh build-all -aamd64 -cxenial

# The build may last about an hour, depending on your CPU speed.
# If the build is successful, you will have a bunch of .deb files in /usr/src/freeswitch-debs
# Please see the log files in /usr/src/freeswitch-debs/log/ folder to monitor the build in progress or trouble shoot build issues once the util.sh script has been completed.
 
```

  
Note that when installed from packages FreeSWITCH Packages use an FHS complaint directory layout. Binaries are installed in "/usr/bin/freeswitch", configs in "/etc/freeswitch", etc.
