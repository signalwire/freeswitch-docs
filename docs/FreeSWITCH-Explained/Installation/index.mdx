## Conventions

The FreeSWITCH™ numbering format is "version.release.maintenance".

## Selecting a Version

The primary FreeSWITCH™ releases are:

* **Current** **_Public Release 1.10_**, created 5 August, 2019, is **recommended for production systems**. Sounds and prompts release is 1.0.52 as of 19 August, 2016.
* _**Current B** **ranch**_, contains in-test fixes going into the _**next maintenance level** of the current public release_.
* **Development**,containing the latest fixes and features, intended as the **_next release_**.

A Note About Bugs and Issues

Bugs or issues with the current public release _must_ be tested using the _latest_ Development release to determine if the problem is already fixed. Issues must be tested using Development before opening bug reports for them to be considered. If the bug persists in Development, then file an issue on GitHub: <https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/issues>

Check Release Notes Before Upgrades

There are breaking changes between minor and major releases, so make sure to check the [Release Notes](../Release-Notes/index.mdx#-freeswitch--release-notes-) before upgrading to avoid headaches.

If you're using FreeSWITCH™ version 1.8 which is tagged **End Of Life**, you should upgrade to 1.10 NOW.

### Download Current Public Release

The latest maintenance level of the current public release of FreeSWITCH™ can be downloaded from [freeswitch-files](https://files.freeswitch.org/freeswitch-releases/) via a browser. For linux, it's easier to copy/paste the command line below. This single long line performs: 1- Determines the latest public release available. 2- Downloads the compressed source file. 3- Decompresses the file into a folder in the current directory. 4- Renames the folder to **freeswitch**. If you don't want the folder renamed, remove the last && to the end of the line.

```xml
FSfile=$(curl -s https://files.freeswitch.org/releases/freeswitch/ | grep -oE "freeswitch-[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.-release\.tar\.bz2" | tail -n 1) && echo Downloading $FSfile && curl https://files.freeswitch.org/freeswitch-releases/$FSfile | tar -xj && mv ${FSfile/.tar.bz2//} freeswitch

```

### Download Current Branch

Download the current branch using the -b argument followed by 'v' concatenated with the release number. The git command creates the **freeswitch** directory and downloads the FreeSWITCH™ source files, replace # with the release number. 

```xml
git clone –b v1.# https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch.git
```

### Download Development

Download the latest development release using the "git clone" command below which creates the **freeswitch** directory and downloads the FreeSWITCH™ development source files.

```xml
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch.git
```

If you're new to FreeSWITCH™ consider purchasing the [Mastering FreeSWITCH™ book](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-freeswitch) and be sure to read this introductory article: <http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Issues/2009/106/TALK-SOFT>.

  
## Installation Methods

**Pre-Built Binaries**

The easiest way to get FreeSWITCH™ is to install a pre-built package for your operating system, available for some [Linux ](./Linux/index.mdx#about)distributions and [Windows](./Windows-Install_1966780.mdx#about).

### Debian 12 Package (FreeSWITCH 1.10)

[Debian](./Linux/Debian_67240088.mdx#about) (preferred) The development team uses and builds against Debian. They recommend Debian because of its operationally stable, yet updated, kernel and wide library support. 

### Centos 7 Package (FreeSWITCH 1.10)

[CentOS 7 and RHEL 7](./Linux/CentOS-7-and-RHEL-7_10289546.mdx#-freeswitch--centos-7-and-rhel-7-)  

### Windows

[Freeswitch Installer .msi](https://files.freeswitch.org/windows/installer/x64/)

The binary MSI installer is built for each release. You can also find [sound packages here](https://files.freeswitch.org/windows/installer/x64/sounds/).

**Compiling Source Code**

FreeSWITCH™ is available for source compilation on Unix , Linux, macOS, and Windows for the following reasons:

* Pre-built binaries are not available
* You want to see the entire process
* You want to build the Development version because you require the very latest features or patches, or wish to hack FreeSWITCH

### Debian 12 Bookworm Source

FreeSWITCH™ 1.10 depends on a number of libraries included with Debian 12, which is the distribution of choice for FS core development team. Follow the instructions on the [Debian](./Linux/Debian_67240088.mdx#about) page; refer to [Debian Post-Install Tasks](Linux/Deprecated-Installation-Instructions/Debian-Post-Install-Tasks_13172868.mdx#about) for finishing touches.

### macOS

There is an [installer](./macOS/macOS-Installation/macOS-macFI-Installation_1966731.mdx#about) and comprehensive [macOS](./macOS/index.mdx#about) guide containing instructions for setting up FreeSwitch™ on a Mac with features such as autostart, emailing voicemails and log management.

### OpenBSD

Special notes for building from source on OpenBSD.

### Smartos

Recently updated installation guide for [SmartOS](./Virtualization/SmartOS_3375391.mdx#uuid)

### Windows

See Install From Source on [Windows Install](Windows-Install_1966780.mdx#install-from-source) page.
  
  
## Updating Binaries

Config Changes

In version 1.4 the names of a number of configuration settings were changed, so you can not simply use old config files on your new FreeSWITCH™ binaries.

Settings of the form sip\_\*\_media have become rtp\_\*\_media because they properly control RTP media streams, SIP has nothing to do with them.

For example, sip\_secure\_media is now called rtp\_secure\_media

  
## Deprecated Instructions

**Deprecated Compiling From Source Code**

These deprecated instructions are FreeSWITCH you may compile from source code. FreeSWITCH™ is available for source compilation on Unix and Linux distributions as well as Windows.

| There were some individuals porting FreeSWITCH over to RPi. I don't know how the recent FS 1.6 changes affect that effort, however. Many of the changes in FS 1.6 involved switching to system libraries in Debian 8 along with greatly improved video conferencing support. Since an RPi is not up to the task of video processing I'm guessing you could omit much of that if you want to stay current with FS 1.6 or use the 1.4 branch. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at Sep 18, 2015 14:09                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| As far as I can tell, 1.6 means the end of hosting FS on R-Pi. In fact, there are no packages for arm in the repo.

| A core motto of FreeSWITCH is: "Don't glue the Lego pieces together"FS is a modular system so you are not required to build every last piece, especially the extensive video components that come with 1.6 version. If you trim down what you build to the bare essentials there's no reason it should not run on RPi.These wiki comments don't see much exposure, so you're much better off asking on the Freeswitch-users mailing list. I know there is interest out there, but it is up to those who have the interest and expertise in RPi to take the ball and run with it. I'm pretty sure the core team doesn't have the wherewithal to port FS to RPi or other architectures as they have their hands full just getting things right with Debian ![(smile)](/images/icons/emoticons/smile.svg) ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at Nov 09, 2015 10:41 |
| John,I dug into the deps-most package found in the 1.6 installation instructions and attempted to manually install each of them. Out of 47 dependencies, I found 11 of them were not available in the raspbian repos. These are the packages that were not available. libpng16-dev libvpx2-dev \| libvpx-dev (>= 1.4.0)libyuv-devlibbroadvoice-dev libcodec2-devlibflite-devlibg7221-devlibilbc-devlibsilk-devlibsngtc-devlibmongoc-devCan you offer any advice on how to determine which modules depend on these? I've searched a few in confluence and have found one reference to libyuv in mod\_fsv, but I'm thiking there's got to be a better way to check if these are things I must have. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by tom@tomlynn.com at Nov 22, 2015 20:57                                                                                             |
