# How To Create a SignalWire Personal Access Token 


## Obtaining an Access Token


A SignalWire account is now required to download the pre-build FreeSWITCH binaries. First [create a SignalWire space](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/signing-up-for-a-space),
then go to the `Personal Access Tokens` section located on the left side of the dashboard. From there, create a Personal Access Token. [Click here to learn more](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Debian).

## Revoking an Access Token

To initiate the revocation of your Personal Access Token, please navigate to the `Personal Access Tokens` section within your
SignalWire space. Within this section, you will be presented with a list of previously created tokens alongside the option to revoke them.

## Recap of Previous Sent Email

In case you missed the previous emails on the matter, here is the recap of this change:

- This specifically (and only) affects the built copy of the FreeSWITCH software - the binaries that turn Linux into FreeSWITCH instantly.
- It does not impact actively running instances or change the process for accessing the open-source code, which will continue to be freely available on GitHub.
- It may affect how you obtain FreeSWITCH dependencies or FreeSWITCH packages from our package repositories such as our Debian repository.
- The changes do not affect our FreeSWITCH Advantage method of authenticating.
