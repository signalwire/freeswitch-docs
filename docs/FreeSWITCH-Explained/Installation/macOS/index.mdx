## About

This is a complete guide for installing FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites on macOS, and for establishing 24x7 operation.

****What Is FreeSWITCH™?** 
**[FreeSWITCH™](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSWITCH)** is an **[application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application%5Fsoftware)** that manages **[VOIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voip)** phones and connections to **[ITSPs (Internet Telephony Service Providers)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITSP).**

**What Can You Do With FreeSWITCH™?** 
It's powerful customization provides our incoming calls to do this: Normal ringing is replaced by: “Hi Pam, hold on while our phones ring", phones ring and Pam hears music, after 25 seconds: “hold on Pam while our iPhones ring", internal phones keep ringing and multiple iPhones ring, if no answer: “sorry we missed you Pam, please leave a message", Pam’s voicemail is taken and emailed to multiple iPhones! 

**Who Are These Pages For?** 
This document is for people who want to install FreeSWITCH™ on macOS and are not familiar with Linux/Unix commands and directories.

**How This Documentation Was Developed and Maintained** 
FreeSWITCH™ is tested and runs 24x7 on a [headless](macOS-Customization_9634513.mdx#remotely-accessing-a-mac) Mac Mini. There was almost no FreeSWITCH™/macOS information when I replaced a VOIP PBX in 2010\. So I compiled what I learned through searching, trial and error, the [FreeSWITCH™ mailing list](http://lists.freeswitch.org/), etc. and created this documentation.
