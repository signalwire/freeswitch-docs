## Archived Page

Archived Obsolete - No Longer Maintained

As of September 30, 2015, the OS X 10.8 page is no longer maintained by the original author and is marked as archived. The reasons are:

* The FreeSWITCH web pages and normal download sites are now protected by TLS 1.2\. OS X 10.8 does not support TLS 1.2 so cannot access the wiki and other pages. The download instructions also do not work as they now require TLS 1.2\. If you absolutely need to download FreeSWITCH using OS X 10.8 you should search the mailing list for using ssh, tarballs, etc.
* There is no prerequisite support for FreeSWITCH versions beyond 1.4.

Although it's technically possible to generate FreeSWITCH on OS X 10.8 it's not worth the effort and time.

## About

OS X Limited to FreeSwitch 1.4 Until Further Notice

September 9 2015: Until further notice, FreeSWITCH™ version 1.6 and later cannot be built on OS X due to new extensive prerequisite requirements. The prior 1.4 Production version must be used until the new prerequisites are resolved. This page will be updated at that time

This is part of the [Installation and Setup on OS X](./Installation-and-Setup-on-OS-X_1966082.mdx#ssh) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of FreeSWITCH™ using the following components **Installed and tested September 9, 2015:** 

* OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 (10.8 built clean, not upgraded from a prior OS X release)
* Xcode 5.1.1 and its Command Line Utilities

The OS X FreeSWITCH™ Installer

The OS X FreeSWITCH™ Installer simplifies installation and saves time! Check it out at [macOS macFI Installation](../macOS-Installation/macOS-macFI-Installation_1966731.mdx#about).

xxx

Some information on this page is for people who want a little more than others. _If you're not too technical don't let the explanations intimidate you._ Just follow the steps and FreeSWITCH™ should be installed in about an hour.

## Getting Help

If you encounter problems search the web, if you can't find an answer join and post to the [FreeSWITCH-users mailing list](http://lists.freeswitch.org/).

## OS X System Security

It is _not recommended_ to perform this procedure while logged on as root. The administrator password is required minimally, resulting in a couple of extra prompts and a safer system.

---

## Preparation

### Backup

Athough it's easy to remove FreeSWITCH™, it's prerequisites, and Xcode following the instructions below, it's best to backup before starting this procedure.

### Terminal Application Preferences

We'll use the Terminal application extensively during installation and to start FreeSWITCH™ initially. You should make the following changes to save time during this procedure:

1. Copy Terminal in the Applications/Utilities folder into the [Dock](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2474) for quick access.
2. Start the Terminal application by clicking it in the dock. Then open its preferences panel.
3. In Settings–>Window change the Window Size to larger values such as 140x48 to reduce having to resize the window often.
4. In Settings–>Window change Scrollback to Limit to Available Memory or a larger number. A lot of messages are produced that you may need to view.
5. In Settings–>Shell change Prompt before closing to "Only if there are processes other than:". This prevents the Terminal window from closing when FreeSWITCH™ is shutdown if it started automatically, which would result in the loss of all messages in the window. This is useful during debugging. If FreeSWITCH™ started manually the window does not close.

---

## OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [GCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%5FCompiler%5FCollection), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites.

### Install Xcode

Xcode 5.1.1 is no longer available from the [OS X App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) so must be downloaded from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory). _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_

You can perform all editing using Textedit, however, you should become familiar with the Xcode editor. Its advantage is that it displays [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) code colorized so you can find syntax errors quickly. This is ideal for editing FreeSWITCH™ XML configuration files.

### Install Command Line Tools (CLT)

_**The stand-alone Command Line Tools should be installed after installing Xcode**_ as follows:

1. Start Xcode.
2. Open Preferences and click on Downloads.
3. Click Install for Command Line Tools will download and install in a few minutes into /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer and various system directories.

---

## Setup Installation Directories

OS X provides the /usr directory which contains subdirectories. This procedure adds the directory **local** to /usr as /usr/local where FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisite [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source%5Fcode) and [runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime%5Flibrary) files are placed. These files are kept out of OS X supplied directories to allow easy removal of FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites.

### Show Invisible Files and Directories in the Finder

OS X hides many Unix directories and files from the Finder including the directories created by this procedure. These files and directories can be unhidden so they appear on the desktop, Finder windows and file dialogs. Additional information and scripts for showing invisible files are in the [Installation and Setup on OS X](./Installation-and-Setup-on-OS-X_1966082.mdx#invisible-files-and-directories) guide. View hidden files by running the lines below in Terminal:

```xml
  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
  killall Finder
```

### **Create /usr Subdirectories**

The user name (owner) and group name of /usr/local and it's subdirectories must match the user and group FreeSWITCH™ will run under. This is typically the main user name of the Mac. View this information (yourname and yourgroup) by running the following command in Terminal:

```xml
  ls -l ~/
```

The user name and group appear in the third and fourth columns. Now create the /usr/local and /usr/local/src directories, replace yourname and yourgroup with the ones obtained from the previous command:

```xml
  cd /usr                                   # Change to the /usr directory
  sudo mkdir local                          # Create the /usr/local directory
  sudo chown -R yourname:yourgroup local    # Modify the owner of the /usr/local directory to yours
  mkdir local/src                           # Create the /usr/local/src directory FreeSWITCH™ source will be downloaded into
```

You will access /usr/local often so it should be placed in the Finder "FAVORITES" sidebar for quick access. Navigate to the /usr/local folder in the Finder, then drag the **local** folder under "FAVORITES".

If you're interested: Even though OS X did not contain the /usr/local directory, /usr/local/bin is defined at the end of the default OS X path. The path is viewed by running "echo $PATH" in Terminal. If you don't understand this, don't worry, it doesn't affect anything.

## Prerequisites

### Prerequisite Installation Options

Additional programs are required to generate and run FreeSWITCH™. It is _strongly recommended to follow this procedure using the Homebrew [package manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem)_ and its [repository](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software%5Frepository) of products for OS X. Homebrew saves time since there is no need to locate packages and determine the version required for each OS X release. Homebrew's [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) repository is maintained by volunteers. 

Alternatively, other techniques for installing prerequisites and FreeSWITCH™ can be viewed on the [Installation on OS X Alternatives](./Installation-on-OS-X-Alternatives_1966101.mdx#about) documentation. This is discouraged but is made available for those who don’t want to use Homebrew.

  
### Install Package Manager and Prerequisites

Using the commands below the package manager and prerequisites install in under 10 minutes.

#### Install Homebrew

Homebrew installation is simple, the command can be run from any directory:

1. Go to the bottom of the [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew) page and copy the ruby command.
2. Open terminal if not already opened, paste and run the command
3. Run the command "brew doctor" to verify homebrew works, this command could take a couple of minutes.

#### Install Required Packages

The basic FreeSWITCH™ prerequisite packages are installed by running the following command in Terminal from any directory:

```xml
  brew install autoconf automake curl jpeg ldns libtool openssl pcre pkg-config speex sqlite
```

Some packages produce _keg-only_ messages which can be ignored. It means an alias (link) for the package was not placed into /usr/local/bin because brew found that OS X has another version installed. This is not a problem because the FreeSWITCH™ installation process searches Homebrew directories to find packages.

Homebrew has never failed in all tests but if any prerequisite fails to install it must be resolved before continuing. First, check if you are using an OS X or Xcode that was upgraded, if so read the warnings at the top of the [Installation on OS X Alternatives](./Installation-on-OS-X-Alternatives_1966101.mdx#about) page.

---

## Download FreeSWITCH™

OS X is now ready to download and install FreeSWITCH™. This takes about 20 minutes.

### Selecting a Version

There are two versions of FreeSWITCH™ to choose from: the **_current release_** version recommended for production systems, and _**master**_ containing the latest fixes and features used duringdevelopment. The current release version is recommended unless you need newer features or patches added since the current release of FreeSWITCH™. Additional Information is located at [Source Options](https://confluence.freeswitch.org/display/FREESWITCH/Installation#Installation-SourceOptions).

This documentation is tested with the master version to keep it as recent as possible and to provide feedback to the developers. If there are problems the developers may request that you install the master version for diagnosis.

### Download Using Git Clone

Download FreeSWITCH™ by switching to the src directory and invoking one of the "git clone" commands below. The git command will create the **freeswitch** directory in src (/usr/local/src/freeswitch) and download the FreeSWITCH™ source files.

```xml
  cd /usr/local/src
  git clone -b v1.4 https://stash.freeswitch.org/scm/fs/freeswitch.git             # The current release version
        or
  git clone https://stash.freeswitch.org/scm/fs/freeswitch.git                     # The master/development version
```

---

## Install FreeSWITCH™

### Generate Installation and Configuration Files

This step creates installation files based on the operating system and installed packages. ./bootstrap.sh creates many files such as modules.conf used to add optional functionality to FreeSWITCH™, while ./configure sets [compilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%5FCompiler%5FCollection) options. Enter the following commands (each will run several minutes):

```xml
  cd freeswitch    # <- the new freeswitch directory created by the git clone process
  ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure
```

### Add Text To Speech Module

Optional functions are added to FreeSWITCH™ by editing the modules.conf file, this may be required as your FreeSWITCH™ configuration becomes more complex. Although not required, adding FLITE Text To Speech functionality is recommended. The easiest way to add the FLITE module is to paste and run the following line into Terminal:

```xml
   perl -pi -e 's{#asr_tts/mod_flite}{asr_tts/mod_flite}' /usr/local/src/freeswitch/modules.conf
```

If you prefer to manually edit the modules.conf file use this procedure:

1. Use the Finder to navigate to the /usr/local/src/freeswitch directory.
2. Scroll to and double-click modules.conf in the freeswitch directory, the first time requires application selection, Textedit should be used.
3. Search for "flite" and remove the # to uncomment.
4. Save the file.

_If this is your first FreeSWITCH™ don't add more than the FLITE module. Some modules may have prerequisites in addition to what is listed in this procedure._

### Compile, Create Additional Source Directories and Check for Errors

This step compiles the programs and creates additional directories and files based on modules.conf. It can run longer than 10 minutes. While still in /usr/local/src/freeswitch compile FreeSWITCH™ with the following command:

```xml
  make
```

If there are no errors proceed, otherwise seek assistance from the [FreeSWITCH-users mailing list](http://lists.freeswitch.org/)

### Generate FreeSWITCH™ Runtime

This creates the /usr/local/freeswitch [runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime%5Flibrary) library and executable programs.

```xml
  make install
```

#### Download and Install Sounds

There are mandatory sound prompts and optional music on hold files. All must be compiled to run the sample IVR. There are four versions available:

* sounds-install moh-install (8 kHz)
* hd-sounds-install hd-moh-install (16 kHz)
* uhd-sounds-install uhd-moh-install (32 kHz)
* cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install (48 kHz)

The cd sounds are recommended since all the sampling rates are provided resulting in fewer problems. Invoke the following command:

```xml
  make cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install
```

#### Cleanup

This optional step can be performed to save space by removing the temporary files created by make:

```xml
  make clean
```

#### Installation is Complete!

Continue at [Installation and Setup on OS X - Installation is Complete](./Installation-and-Setup-on-OS-X_1966082.mdx#installation-is-complete).

## Updating

### Updating FreeSWITCH™

FreeSWITCH™ may occasionally require updating due to new features, fixes, etc. To download the latest updates, compile FreeSWITCH™ and create updated runtime binaries, run the following two commands:

```xml
  cd /usr/local/src/freeswitch
  git pull && make current
```

### Updating Prerequisites

To update Homebrew and its formulas run "brew update" in Terminal, this should be run prior to upgrading packages. To upgrade all packages, run "brew upgrade", or to upgrade a single package run "brew upgrade _package-name_" command.

---

## Removal

### Removing FreeSWITCH™

Consider backing up modified or new configuration files you created! FreeSWITCH™ is completely removed by deleting the /usr/local/freeswitch and /usr/local/src/freeswitch directories using the Finder (drag to trash) or in Terminal:

```xml
  rm -r /usr/local/freeswitch
  rm -r /usr/local/src/freeswitch
```

### Remove Homebrew and Prerequisites

Packages installed by Homebrew are listed using the "brew list" command. They are removed using the "brew uninstall _package-name_" command. To remove packages and Homebrew run the following in Terminal:

```xml
rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git && brew cleanup
sudo rm -r /Library/Caches/Homebrew   # (OS X prompts for the administrator password)
```

### Remove Xcode

Xcode is installed as an OS X package (directory) that looks like a single application file. To remove Xcode drag the application to the trash, empty it and restart OS X. To remove the Command Line Tools:

Copy and paste the following script: into a new text file named removeCLT.sh

RemoveCLT.sh

RECEIPT\_FILE=/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.DeveloperToolsCLI.bom  
RECEIPT\_PLIST=/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.DeveloperToolsCLI.plist  
  
if \[ ! -f "$RECEIPT\_FILE" \]  
then  
 echo "Command Line Tools not installed."  
 exit 1  
fi  
  
echo "Command Line Tools installed, removing ..."  
  
\# Need to be at root  
cd /  
  
\# Remove files and dirs mentioned in the "Bill of Materials" (BOM)  
lsbom -fls $RECEIPT\_FILE | sudo xargs -I{} rm -r "{}"  
  
\# remove the receipt  
sudo rm $RECEIPT\_FILE  
  
\# remove the plist  
sudo rm $RECEIPT\_PLIST  
  
RECEIPT\_FILE=/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.DevSDK.bom  
RECEIPT\_PLIST=/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.DevSDK.plist  
  
if \[ ! -f "$RECEIPT\_FILE" \]  
then  
 echo "SDK not installed."  
 exit 1  
fi  
  
echo "SDK installed, removing ..."  
  
\# Need to be at root  
cd /  
  
\# Remove files and dirs mentioned in the "Bill of Materials" (BOM)  
lsbom -fls $RECEIPT\_FILE | sudo xargs -I{} rm -r "{}"  
  
\# remove the receipt  
sudo rm $RECEIPT\_FILE  
  
\# remove the plist  
sudo rm $RECEIPT\_PLIST  
  
echo "Done!"

Make the script executable and run it (add and prefix directories to its location):

```xml
 chmod +x removeCLT.sh
./removeCLT.sh
```

### Remove Everything Else

If the /usr/local directory existed prior to using this procedure it has to be examined to determine if the contents are deletable. If the instructions on this page were followed, _**and the /usr/local directory was created during this procedure**_, everything can be removed to roll back the system prior to using this procedure by performing these steps:

1. Drag directory /usr/local to the trash. Or delete it in Terminal (OS X prompts for the administrator password):  
```xml  
  sudo rm -r /usr/local  
```

### Hide Invisible Files and Directories in the Finder

To reverse the show hidden files step, open the Terminal application and run each line below. All hidden files will disappear from the desktop, Finder and file dialogs.

```xml
  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO
  killall Finder
```
