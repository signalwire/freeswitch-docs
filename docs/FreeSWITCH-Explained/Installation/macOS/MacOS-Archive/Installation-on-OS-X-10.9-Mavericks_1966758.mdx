As of December 31, 2016, FreeSWITCH is no longer tested on OS X Mavericks. Apple dropped support and no longer issues security patches. Homebrew also no longer officially supports Mavericks.

At the time of this notice, FreeSWITCH still installed and worked fine on Mavericks. If desired, you can attempt to download Xcode using the lines below and follow the manual installation instructions.

Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer.

Mavericks 10.9: download and install Xcode 6.2 from [Xcode 6.2 Download](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer%5FTools/Xcode%5F6.2/Xcode%5F6.2.dmg) then start Xcode.

## About

This is part of the [macOS Installation](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#about) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of components that may be unique to OS X 10.9**.**

## OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), [Clang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites. The Command Line Tools are included and automatically installed with Xcode. The Apple Developer site offers the **standalone CLT** but it _**cannot be used because Homebrew will not install without the** **Xcode/CLT version.**_

### Install Xcode 6

Xcode 6.2 is no longer available from the [OS X App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) so must be downloaded from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the CLT in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_
