macOS FreeSWITCH™ ObsoletedReleases 

FreeSWITCH is not tested on obsoleted releases. Apple and Homebrew dropped support and no longer issues security patches. You may work around issues if you use the [manual installation](../macOS-Installation/macOS-Manual-Installation_13174557.mdx#installation-directories) instructions with your own modifications.
