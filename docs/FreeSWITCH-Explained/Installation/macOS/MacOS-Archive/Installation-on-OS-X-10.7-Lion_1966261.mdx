Archived Obsolete - No Longer Maintained

As of September 30, 2015, the OS X 10.7 page is no longer maintained by the original author and is marked as archived. The reasons are:

* The FreeSWITCH web pages and normal download sites are now protected by TLS 1.2\. OS X 10.7 does not support TLS 1.2 so cannot access the wiki and other pages. The download instructions also do not work as they now require TLS 1.2\. If you absolutely need to download FreeSWITCH using OS X 10.7 you should search the mailing list for using ssh, tarballs, etc.
* FreeSWITCH generation cannot use the last Xcode version supported on OS X 10.7\. Xcode must be used to build a clang compiler than can be used. The instructions below describe the steps but there is no telling when the old clang compiler will become incompatible with FreeSWITCH.
* There is no prerequisite support for FreeSWITCH versions beyond 1.4.
* Last but not least, see the note below for September 9, 2015.

Although it's probably technically possible to generate FreeSWITCH on OS X 10.7 it's not worth the effort and time.

About

OS X 10.7 Cannot be used for FreeSWITCH

September 9 2015: Starting June 30 2015, FreeSWITCH™ can no longer be compiled on OS X 10.7 due to compiler incompatibilities. Multiple compilers were tested and all failed. The information below is based on the last version of FreeSWITCH™ from May 2015 that compiled on OS X 10.7.

In addition, versions greater than 1.4 cannot be created on OS X 10.7 due to new extensive prerequisite requirements.

This is part of the [Installation and Setup on OS X](./Installation-and-Setup-on-OS-X_1966082.mdx#ssh) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of FreeSWITCH™ using the following components **Installed and tested May 14, 2015:** 

* OS X Lion 10.7.5 (10.7 built clean, not upgraded from a prior OS X release)
* Command Line Utilities for Lion
* LLVM-Clang 3.6 Compiler
* Homebrew and other prerequisites
* FreeSWITCH™ 1.5.15b+git\~20150514 development version

Note that two compilers are used. FreeSWITCH™ installation requires a compiler newer than what is provided by Command Line Utilities for Lion. However, newer compilers are not available in binary for OS X 10.7 so the Apple CLTs are used to build a newer LLVM/Clang compiler.

Some information on this page is for people who want a little more than others. _If you're not too technical don't let the explanations intimidate you._ Just follow the steps and FreeSWITCH™ should be installed in about an hour.

## Getting Help

If you encounter problems search the web, if you can't find an answer join and post to the [FreeSWITCH-users mailing list](http://lists.freeswitch.org/).

## OS X System Security

It is _not recommended_ to perform this procedure while logged on as root. The administrator password is required minimally, resulting in a couple of extra prompts and a safer system.

## Preparation

### Backup

Even though it's easy to remove FreeSWITCH™ and it's prerequisites, removing the Apple Command Line Tools is difficult at this time. Although there is no problem leaving the CLT installed, If you want to remove them it's best to backup before starting this procedure.

### Terminal Application Preferences

We'll use the Terminal application extensively during installation and to start FreeSWITCH™ initially. You should make the following changes to save time during this procedure:

1. Copy Terminal in the Applications/Utilities folder into the [Dock](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2474) for quick access.
2. Start the Terminal application by clicking it in the dock. Then open its preferences panel.
3. In Settings–>Window change the Window Size to larger values such as 140x48 to reduce having to resize the window often.
4. In Settings–>Window change Scrollback to Limit to Available Memory or a larger number. A lot of messages are produced that you may need to view.
5. In Settings–>Shell change Prompt before closing to "Only if there are processes other than:". This prevents the Terminal window from closing when FreeSWITCH™ is shutdown if it started automatically, which would result in the loss of all messages in the window. This is useful during debugging. If FreeSWITCH™ started manually the window does not close.

---

## OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [GCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%5FCompiler%5FCollection), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites.

### Xcode

Xcode 4.6.3 is _**NOT REQUIRED**_ for FreeSWITCH™ installation on OS X 10.7 and should not be installed. If it's required for something else it can be downloaded from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory). _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_

### Install Command Line Tools (CLT)

If the Command Lines Tools are already installed skip to [Setup Installation Directories](#setup-installation-directories). Otherwise the Command Line Utilities for Lion must be downloaded from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Download and follow the directions to Install the Command Line Tools into various system directories.

---

## Setup Installation Directories

OS X provides the /usr directory which contains subdirectories. This procedure adds the directory **local** to /usr as /usr/local where FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisite [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source%5Fcode) and [runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime%5Flibrary) files are placed. These files are kept out of OS X supplied directories to allow easy removal of FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites.

### Show Invisible Files and Directories in the Finder

OS X hides many Unix directories and files from the Finder including the directories created by this procedure. These files and directories can be unhidden so they appear on the desktop, Finder windows and file dialogs. Additional information and scripts for showing invisible files are in the [Installation and Setup on OS X](./Installation-and-Setup-on-OS-X_1966082.mdx#invisible-files-and-directories) guide. View hidden files by running the lines below in Terminal:

```xml
  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
  killall Finder
```

### **Create /usr Subdirectories**

The user name (owner) and group name of /usr/local and it's subdirectories must match the user and group FreeSWITCH™ will run under. This is typically the main user name of the Mac. View this information (yourname and yourgroup) by running the following command in Terminal:

```xml
  ls -l ~/
```

The user name and group appear in the third and fourth columns. Now create the /usr/local and /usr/local/src directories, replace yourname and yourgroup with the ones obtained from the previous command:

```xml
  cd /usr                                   # Change to the /usr directory
  sudo mkdir local                          # Create the /usr/local directory
  sudo chown -R yourname:yourgroup local    # Modify the owner of the /usr/local directory to yours
  mkdir local/src                           # Create the /usr/local/src directory FreeSWITCH™ source will be downloaded into
```

You will access /usr/local often so it should be placed in the Finder "FAVORITES" sidebar for quick access. Navigate to the /usr/local folder in the Finder, then drag the **local** folder under "FAVORITES".

If you're interested: Even though OS X did not contain the /usr/local directory, /usr/local/bin is defined at the end of the default OS X path. The path is viewed by running "echo $PATH" in Terminal. If you don't understand this, don't worry, it doesn't affect anything.

## Prerequisites

### Prerequisite Installation Options

Additional programs are required to generate and run FreeSWITCH™. It is _strongly recommended to follow this procedure using the Homebrew [package manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem)_ and its [repository](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software%5Frepository) of products for OS X. Homebrew saves time since there is no need to locate packages and determine the version required for each OS X release. Homebrew's [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) repository is maintained by volunteers. 

Alternatively, other techniques for installing prerequisites and FreeSWITCH™ can be viewed on the [Installation on OS X Alternatives](./Installation-on-OS-X-Alternatives_1966101.mdx#about) documentation. This is discouraged but is made available for those who don’t want to use Homebrew.

  
### Install Package Manager and Prerequisites

Using the commands below the package manager and prerequisites install in under 10 minutes.

#### Install Homebrew

Homebrew installation is simple, the command can be run from any directory:

1. Go to the bottom of the [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew) page and copy the ruby command.
2. Open terminal if not already opened, paste and run the command
3. Run the command "brew doctor" to verify homebrew works, this command could take a couple of minutes. Note that if Xcode is not installed there is a warning which can be ignored.

#### Install LLVM Clang

The Command Line Tools are too out-of-date to build FreeSWITCH™ so they are used to build an updated compiler and tools called LLVM and clang. These are installed by running the following commands in Terminal from any directory:

```xml
  brew install llvm --with-clang         <- This can take 30-60 minutes
  brew link -force llvm                  <- See warning below 
  cd /usr/local/bin
  ln -s clang cc                         <- Creates aliases
  ln -s clang gcc
  ln -s clang c++
  ln -s clang g++
```

If LLVM is updated to a newer release, delete the aliases in /usr/local/bin, run "brew link -force llvm", and recreate the aliases above!

#### Place New Tools In Path

Set OS X to find the brew installed packages by default instead of the old OS X versions:

1. Open the top level directory which is the partition/drive OS X is installed on and locate the "etc" directory.
2. Drag the /etc/paths file to the desktop
3. Double click the paths file on the desktop to open and edit it.
4. Move the /usr/local/bin line (usually the last) to the top so it is first.
5. Drag the paths file back to the /etc directory, it will request authentication.
6. Reboot or logoff and back on for the new paths take effect.
7. In Terminal, type "echo $PATH" to verify it's changed.
8. OPTIONAL: From Terminal run "sudo chown -R 0:wheel /private/etc/paths to reset owner to the original state before the change,

#### Install Required Packages

The basic FreeSWITCH™ prerequisite packages are installed by running the following command in Terminal from any directory:

```xml
  brew install autoconf automake curl jpeg ldns libtool openssl pcre pkg-config speex sqlite
```

Some packages produce _keg-only_ messages. It means an alias (link) for the package was not placed into /usr/local/bin because brew found that OS X has another version installed. This is normally not a problem because the FreeSWITCH™ installation process searches Homebrew directories to find packages. For OS X to find the packages run the following command:

```xml
  brew link -force curl openssl readline sqlite
```

If the prerequisites that were force linked are upgraded by "brew upgrade", they must be link forced again.

Homebrew has never failed in all tests but if any prerequisite fails to install it must be resolved before continuing.

## Download FreeSWITCH™

OS X is now ready to download and install FreeSWITCH™. This takes about 20 minutes.

### Selecting a Version

There are two versions of FreeSWITCH™ to choose from: the **_current r_** _**elease**_ version recommended for production systems, and _**master**_ containing the latest fixes and features used duringdevelopment. The current release version is recommended unless you need newer features or patches added since the current release of FreeSWITCH™. Additional Information is located at [Source Options](https://confluence.freeswitch.org/display/FREESWITCH/Installation#Installation-SourceOptions).

This documentation is tested with the master version to keep it as recent as possible and to provide feedback to the developers. If there are problems the developers may request that you install the master version for diagnosis.

### Download Using Git Clone

Download FreeSWITCH™ by switching to the src directory and invoking one of the "git clone" commands below. The git command will create the **freeswitch** directory in src (/usr/local/src/freeswitch) and download the FreeSWITCH™ source files.

```xml
cd /usr/local/src
git clone -b v1.4 https://stash.freeswitch.org/scm/fs/freeswitch.git             # The current release version
      or
git clone https://stash.freeswitch.org/scm/fs/freeswitch.git                     # The master/development version
```

---

## Install FreeSWITCH™

### Generate Installation and Configuration Files

This step creates installation files based on the operating system and installed packages. ./bootstrap.sh creates many files such as modules.conf used to add optional functionality to FreeSWITCH™, while ./configure sets [compilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%5FCompiler%5FCollection) options. Enter the following commands (each will run several minutes):

```xml
  cd freeswitch    # <- the new freeswitch directory created by the git clone process
  ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
```

### Add Text To Speech Module

Optional functions are added to FreeSWITCH™ by editing the modules.conf file, this may be required as your FreeSWITCH™ configuration becomes more complex. Although not required, adding FLITE Text To Speech functionality is recommended. The easiest way to add the FLITE module is to paste and run the following line into Terminal:

```xml
   perl -pi -e 's{#asr_tts/mod_flite}{asr_tts/mod_flite}' /usr/local/src/freeswitch/modules.conf
```

If you prefer to manually edit the modules.conf file use this procedure:

1. Use the Finder to navigate to the /usr/local/src/freeswitch directory.
2. Scroll to and double-click modules.conf in the freeswitch directory, the first time requires application selection, Textedit should be used.
3. Search for "flite" and remove the # to uncomment.
4. Save the file.

_If this is your first FreeSWITCH™ don't add more than the FLITE module. Some modules may have prerequisites in addition to what is listed in this procedure._

__The mod\_v8 module which provides Javascript support does not compile on OSX 10.7.5, if make below fails in mod\_v8 edit modules.conf, locate the line containing "mod\_v8" and insert "#" as the first character on the line then save the file. Otherwise the next step will fail._

### Compile, Create Additional Source Directories and Check for Errors

This step compiles the programs and creates additional directories and files based on modules.conf. It can run longer than 10 minutes. While still in /usr/local/src/freeswitch compile FreeSWITCH™ with the following command:

```xml
  make
```

If there are no errors proceed, otherwise seek assistance from the [FreeSWITCH-users mailing list](http://lists.freeswitch.org/)

### Generate FreeSWITCH™ Runtime

This creates the /usr/local/freeswitch [runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime%5Flibrary) library and executable programs.

```xml
  make install
```

#### Download and Install Sounds

There are mandatory sound prompts and optional music on hold files. All must be compiled to run the sample IVR. There are four versions available:

* sounds-install moh-install (8 kHz)
* hd-sounds-install hd-moh-install (16 kHz)
* uhd-sounds-install uhd-moh-install (32 kHz)
* cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install (48 kHz)

The cd sounds are recommended since all the sampling rates are provided resulting in fewer problems. Invoke the following command:

```xml
  make cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install
```

### Cleanup

This optional step can be performed to save space by removing the temporary files created by make:

```xml
  make clean
```

### Installation is Complete!

## Updating

### Updating FreeSWITCH™

FreeSWITCH™ may occasionally require updating due to new features, fixes, etc. To download the latest updates, compile FreeSWITCH™ and create updated runtime binaries, run the following two commands:

```xml
  cd /usr/local/src/freeswitch
  git pull && make current
```

### Updating Prerequisites

To update Homebrew and its formulas run "brew update" in Terminal, this should be run prior to upgrading packages. To upgrade all packages, run "brew upgrade", or to upgrade a single package run "brew upgrade _package-name_" command.

---

## Removal

The Command Level Tools cannot be removed!

### Remove Everything

If the /usr/local directory existed prior to using this procedure it has to be examined to determine if the contents are deletable. If the instructions on this page were followed, _**and the /usr/local directory was created during this procedure**_, everything can be removed to roll back the system prior to using this procedure by performing these steps:

1. Move the Xcode application to the trash and empty the Trash
2. Drag directories /usr/local and /Library/Caches/Homebrew to the trash. Or delete them in Terminal (OS X prompts for the administrator password):  
```xml  
  sudo rm -r /usr/local  
  sudo rm -r /Library/Caches/Homebrew  
```

### Removing FreeSWITCH™

Consider backing up modified or new configuration files you created! FreeSWITCH™ is completely removed by deleting the /usr/local/freeswitch and /usr/local/src/freeswitch directories using the Finder (drag to trash) or in Terminal:

```xml
  rm -r /usr/local/freeswitch
  rm -r /usr/local/src/freeswitch
```

### Remove Prerequisites

Packages installed by Homebrew are listed using the "brew list" command. They are removed using the "brew uninstall _package-name_" command.

### Remove Xcode

Xcode is installed as an OS X package (directory) that looks like a single application file. It is removed by moving the Xcode application to the trash and emptying it. The CLT cannot be removed.

### Hide Invisible Files and Directories in the Finder

To reverse the show hidden files step, open the Terminal application and run each line below. All hidden files will disappear from the desktop, Finder and file dialogs.

```xml
  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO
  killall Finder
```

## Known Problems

Javascript module mod\_v8 not supported

__As of April 9 2014 the FreeSWITCH™ Javascript module mod\_v8 does not compile on, and will not be supported on OS X 10.7.5\. If Javascript support in FreeSWITCH™ is required upgrade to OS X 10.9 or later._
