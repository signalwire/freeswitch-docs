# macOS Installation Methods

## About

This page describes [FreeSWITCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSWITCH)™ installation methods available for the macOS releases below. It is part of the FreeSWITCH™ [macOS](../index.mdx#about) documentation.  

## Installation Methods

FreeSWITCH™ installation on macOS is performed using these methods on Apple Silicon and Intel Mac computers:

* [Homebrew](#homebrew-installation), the fastest method.
* [macFI installer utility](#macos-freeswitch-installer-macfi), identical to manual but faster and with installation logs.
* [Manually](#manual-installation), if you want to build from source and know every detail of the installation.

## Homebrew Installation

This is the **easiest and fastest way to install FreeSWITCH on macOS.** To perform a Homebrew installation use the [macOS Homebrew Installation](./macOS-Homebrew-Installation_72253508.mdx#about) instructions.

**Advantages**

* Easiest method to install FreeSWITCH™.
* Support for the last three macOS versions.
* Utilizes the least disk space.

**Disadvantages**

* Is provided as a runtime only version, so building optional modules from source is difficult but not usually required.
* Only provides the current production version.
* Information on this wiki is limited to testing results since the Homebrew version is maintained independently from this wiki.

## Manual Build and Testing Status
