Post Dial Delay - the time between the call starts (an INVITE) and there's a progress indication (a 183 or early media).

You can find the delay time set as a channel variable:

_**In Seconds:**_

* progress\_mediasec
* progresssec

_**In milliseconds (1000 = 1 second):**_ 

* **progress\_mediamsec** if there was media
* **progressmsec** if there was no media

_**In MicroSeconds (1000 = 1 millisecond)**_ 

* progress\_mediausec
* progressusec

Only one will be set, the other will be 0\. PDD in seconds = (progress\_mediamsec + progressmsec) / 1000
