## Nagios

kjhosein wrote a plugin (in Perl) that checks various health parameters on a FreeSWITCH server. It takes advantage of the \*fs\_cli\* FreeSWITCH command-line tool. It may be extended to check practically anything that fs\_cli can check.

It currently monitors a handful of things:

* sofia-status-internal - looks for the 'internal' Name and expects to find a state of RUNNING.
* sofia-status-external - looks for the 'external' Name and expects to find a state of RUNNING. Same format as the 'internal' test above.
* show-calls-count - reports total # of current calls.
* sofia-status-profile-internal-failed-calls-in - reports the FAILED-CALLS-IN parameter in the 'sofia status profile internal' query.
* sofia-status-profile-internal-failed-calls-out - reports the FAILED-CALLS-OUT parameter in the 'sofia status profile internal' query.

You may get it and more info from GitHub: <https://github.com/kjhosein/nagios-freeswitch-plugin>

It requires the Nagios::Plugin Perl module (written by Ton Voon).
