# [Miscellaneous] Video-recording 

 


## **OBSOLETE DO NOT FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS**



## Media bug

The **video-media-bug** branch in tree implemented a simple video media bug, for video eavesdrop and recording. You need to manually build this branch before it can be merged into the master tree.

```xml
git checkout video-media-bug
./bootstrap.sh && ./configure && make install
```

## Record a single legged call

[Mod\_fsv](../Modules/mod_fsv_6587435.mdx#about) implemented a record\_fsv application, which can record into a .fsv (FreeSWITCH VIDEO) file format.

```xml
<action application="record_fsv" data="/tmp/testrecord.fsv"/>
```

record\_fsv will also "echo" the video and audio back.

Another method is to use the standard "record" application, added recently. The difference is that it doesn't echo anything back, and has to disable write buffering.

```xml
<action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=false"/>
<action application="record" data="/tmp/testrecord.fsv"/>
```

With [Mod\_mp4v2](../Modules/mod_mp4v2_13173920.mdx#about) you can also record into mp4:

```xml
<action application="record_mp4" data="/tmp/testrecord.mp4"/>
```

or

```xml
<action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=false"/>
<action application="record" data="/tmp/testrecord.mp4"/>
```

## Record a bridged call

```xml
 uuid_setvar <uuid> enable_file_write_buffering false

 uuid_record <uuid> start /tmp/testrecord.fsv
 uuid_record <uuid> start /tmp/testrecord.mp4
```

record\_session should also works, but not been tested. Always disable file writing buffer before recording.

## Record a conference

If record into a video file, it record all active members voice and one member's video - who has the floor.

```xml
conference 3000 record /tmp/testrecord.fsv
conference 3000 record /tmp/testrecord.mp4
```

## Video eavesdrop

Yes, eavesdrop works with video, and, unlike audio, it cannot be "mixed", so you only see a single leg's video while you hear both.

```xml
 originate user/1000 &eavesdrop(someuuid)
```
