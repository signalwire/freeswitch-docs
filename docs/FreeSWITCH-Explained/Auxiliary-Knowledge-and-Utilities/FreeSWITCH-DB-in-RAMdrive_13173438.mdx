# FreeSWITCH DB in RAMdrive 

 

## About

Moving the ephemeral databases to a RAM disk will greatly improve performance, and it is CRITICAL to move them to a RAM disk if you use SSDs. More info on running FreeSWITCH on SSDs is [here](../Configuration/SSD-Tuning-for-Linux_1966304.mdx#about)[.](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/SSD%5FTuning%5Ffor%5FLinux "SSD Tuning for Linux")

## Discussion

Some Linux distros have quirks that cause SQLite to behave poorly when scaling up. In other cases, disk I/O becomes a bottleneck to FreeSWITCH performance. Putting the FreeSWITCH core.db file onto a RAM disk can increase performance.

### Example

1. In /etc/fstab, add a mountpoint and save.  
    
   ```xml  
   tmpfs    /usr/local/freeswitch/ramdisk     tmpfs   defaults        0 0  
   ```
2. Make sure you also create the directory.  
   ```xml  
   mkdir /usr/local/freeswitch/ramdisk  
   mount -a  
   ```
3. Then, in freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/switch.conf.xml uncomment core-db-name and set it to the path you created in fstab.  
   ```xml  
   <param name="core-db-name" value="/usr/local/freeswitch/ramdisk/core.db" />  
   ```
4. Restart FreeSWITCH
