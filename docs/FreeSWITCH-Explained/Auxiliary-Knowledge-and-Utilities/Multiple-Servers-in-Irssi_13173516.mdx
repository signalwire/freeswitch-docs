# Multiple Servers in Irssi 

 

## About

For those who want to keep track of their chats while not online, run irssi in a screen on a Linux box. You can then detach and re-attach your screen (with Irssi in it) from anywhere.

## Irssi

To have your "normal" IRC server in Irssi and then add one is really simple. Just do a /server [irc.freenode.org](http://irc.freenode.org) and you'll have the extra connection. Then you can tag your joins:

```xml
/join -freenode #freeswitch
```

A startup config autojoining your servers and channels in your .irssi dir:

```xml
...
servers = (
  {
    address = "irc.your_normal.net";
    port = "6667";
    use_ssl = "no";
    ssl_verify = "no";
    autoconnect = "yes";
    chatnet = "IRCnet";
  }
  {
    address = "irc.freenode.net";
    port = "6667";
    use_ssl = "no";
    ssl_verify = "no";
    autoconnect = "yes";
    chatnet = "freenode";
  }
);

channels = (
  {
    name = "#freeswitch";
    chatnet = "freenode";
    autojoin = "yes";
  }
);
```
