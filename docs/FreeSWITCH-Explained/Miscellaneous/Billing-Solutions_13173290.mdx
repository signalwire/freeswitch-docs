## DIY Billing for FreeSWITCH

Do it yourself billing for FreeSWITCH by [Avi Marcus](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/User:Avi%5FMarcus "User:Avi Marcus") ([talk](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/User%5Ftalk:Avi%5FMarcus "User talk:Avi Marcus"))

* For post-paid, you can simply post-process the [CDRs](../Configuration/CDR/index.mdx#about).
* To enforce a channel limit per account, you can use limit  
   * &lt;action application="limit" data="hash outbound ${accountcode} 4"/>  
   * For just 1 machine, you can use in-memory 'hash'. To share the limit across several machines, use 'db'.
* For setting a credit limit, you can schedule cutoffs. Calculate many seconds their remaining credit allows, then:  
   * On your A leg: &lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:api\_on\_answer=[sched\_transfer](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fsched%5Ftransfer "Misc. Dialplan Tools sched transfer") +3600 ${uuid} cutoff\_incall"/>  
      * after 3600 seconds from answer, transfer the call to an extension called cutoff\_incall. Or, you can just [sched\_hangup](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/FreeSwitch%5FScheduler%5FAPI#Scheduled%5Fhangup%5Fdialplan%5Fapplication "FreeSwitch Scheduler API") with no message.  
   * You can also [schedule](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/FreeSwitch%5FScheduler%5FAPI#Scheduled%5Fbroadcast%5Fdialplan%5Fapplication "FreeSwitch Scheduler API") a warning message to the A user: &lt;action application="[sched\_broadcast](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/FreeSwitch%5FScheduler%5FAPI#Scheduled%5Fbroadcast%5Fdialplan%5Fapplication "FreeSwitch Scheduler API")" data="+3540 playback::/tmp/1\_minute\_left.wav"/>
* To enforce multiple channels with a strict prepaid, you need to be aware of the other active calls affect on the balance, otherwise 2 expensive calls can use up the remaining balance twice, leading to a large negative.  
   * With $10 on their account, they might initiate two $1/minute calls. If you calculate based on the current balance and allow 2 channels, then each will cut off after $10 -- a $20 bill on only $10 of credit.  
   * [mod\_nibblebill](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fnibblebill "Mod nibblebill") will let you bill calls on a set heartbeat, e.g. every 6 seconds. Be sure to save the charges in your CDRs so you can reconstruct why their balance went up or down.  
   * There might be some other creative, hackish solution, but I haven't implemented one...

### FreeSWITCH Viking

#### Wholesale Application

We are eagerly awaiting his posting an application on the git contrib. I'm finishing a "complete" wholesale application created on freeswitch and I was wondering whether it would be a good idea to put it up on the wiki. I just don't know how.

Features include all the following parameters configurable via web interface:

* Profile creation based on server IP where traffic is received. You can have multiple IPs, system will create multiple profiles/diaplans so it can differentiate.  
   * i.e. offer to the same customer a "gold" routing on IP1 and cheap routing on IP2
* Customer add/modify/delete  
   * IP source  
   * Rates for client routes based on area code  
   * Prepaid or postpaid.  
      * When customer balance is 0, no more calls are allowed.  
   * limit max channels  
   * Media by-pass  
      * When by-passed, customer and provider will exchange RTPs directly. Else, server will be in the middle.
* Provider add/modify/delete  
   * costs for provider routes based on area code  
   * limit max channels
* Routing based on areacode, gives great granularity.
* Routes can be assigned multiple gateways/providers which can in turn be distributed based on weight. Includes overflow to next configured GW.
* Basic financial report generation (totals) by customer/provider
* Basic traffic ASR/ACD report (totals) by customer/provider
* Basic user administration. (No access level, only total access)
* CDR export to csv file.

#### Testing the BETA

You can test the BETA version by getting it from the git:

&lt;git://github.com/davidcsi/FreeSWITCH-Billing.git>

#### Calling Card Application

I also have a prepaid card app... no web interface on that one though. I do the route selecting with a lua script. overflow and load distribution with mod\_distributor loaded via curl.

* You can have multiple card access numbers associated to a card "name"
* Each card is associated with a rate table.
* Each areacode in the rate table has a route to use, which in turn is a distributor gw list.
* Every gateway is actually a provider which also has a cost table associated with it.
* After the call duration is calculated, the app sets a shcedule-api to disconnect the call.
* When the call is hung up, a CDR is posted to the webserver via xml\_cdr.
* This CDR contains all information regarding the call. i.e. rate, cost, clgnum, cldnum, gw\_used, balance\_before, balance\_after, ratetable, costtable, etc...

#### CLI-based/Retail

I have now made a retail version for FreeSWITCH-Billing.

It works like this:

* A specific context is created for this application.
* Any calls which comes in on said context is handled by the retail script.
* The script Looks up the incomming caller ID Number in a DB table.
* The CLI is associated with a "Master" acount via the Master account's ID.
* This Master account has a balance, a rate table and a username/password (for later use, this user will be able to check his traffic, balance, etc via web)
* If the account has a positive balance, the rate table is used to apply a price per minute.
* The Max talk time is calculated and set by the script and the call is sent out using the route tables (already existing in the wholesale side).
* Once the call is finished, the CDR is posted using mod\_xml\_cdr on a web server and the receiving php inserts the cdr into the cdr table, also calculating and setting the cost of the call.

TO DO:

* web pages for the client to check out his balance, clis, etc.

  
I will upload this into the github this weekend!

Have fun!

note: any suggestion is VERY welcome!
