## About

A discussion of the architecture and interfaces of FreeSWITCH.

![Documentation](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/8/84/Diag1.1-small.jpg)

## History

* 1999 Start of Asterisk and OpenH323
* 2003 anthm and bkw Join Asterisk
* 2005 First ClueCon, Asterisk 1.2 Released
* 2006 Start of FreeSWITCH / OpenPBX
* 2007 OpenZAP Introduced
* 2008 FreeSWITCH 1.0 “Phoenix" Released
* 2010 FreeTDM Supersedes OpenZAP
* 2014 WebRTC supported, Verto RTC signaling protocol introduced

## Fundamentals

* Threaded Model (Parallel Operations)
* Stable Protected Core
* Dynamic Modules to Extend Functionality
* Detailed Event and Logger System
* Hooks into Everything

### Threaded Model (Parallel Operations)

* Every connection has its own thread.
* Sub-systems run in background threads.
* Event handlers push events into threads.

### Stable Protected Core

* Critical data structures are opaque.
* Complicated code is all in one place.
* Complicated routines get maximum reuse.
* Higher level code cannot be misused.
* With each new level of API the power increases as the complexity decreases.

### Dynamic Modules

* FSAPI interface allows the addition of commands that can be accessed remotely.
* Application interface allows creation of custom IVRs and call routing apps.
* XML interface allows real-time dynamic access for user directory and configuration.
* Endpoint interface connects IM and phones.
* Formats, Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) & Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Say & Phrase Macros extend input and output capabilities.

### Detailed Event and Logger System

* Events are fired whenever something significant happens.
* Detailed logging makes debugging easier.
* External applications can bind to events and track the status of the entire system.

### Hooks into Everything

* Learn to think 4th dimensionally!
* Embedded languages simplify the API even more.
* Same principle as the CGI / Web server.

## API Comparison

### Lua Version

-- answer the call
session:answer();

-- play a file
session:streamFile("hello.wav");

-- hangup
session:hangup();

### C Version

SWITCH_STANDARD_APP(demo_function)
\{
    switch_channel_t *channel;

    channel = switch_core_session_get_channel(session);

    switch_assert(channel);

    switch_channel_answer(channel);
    switch_core_session_stream_file(session, "hello.wav");
    switch_channel_hangup(channel, SWITCH_CAUSE_NORMAL_CLEARING);
}

## How It All Fits Together

* Low level C code
* Core API
* High level API (Module and IVR API)
* Inter-module communication with events and API calls
* Support for [many programming languages](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Supported%5FProgramming%5FLanguages "Supported Programming Languages")

### Real-Time

* The XML registry (dialplan, user directory, configuration, phrase macros)
* Binding to the sections ([mod\_xml\_curl](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fxml%5Fcurl "Mod xml curl"))
* Poll based info from FSAPI (XML-RPC)
* Push based info from events ([mod\_event\_socket](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fevent%5Fsocket "Mod event socket"))

### FreeTDM

[FreeTDM](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/FreeTDM "FreeTDM") supports

* multiple telephony boards such as Digium and Sangoma.
* PRI, BRI, SS7, MFC-R2 and Analog signaling.

## Future Plans

* Provide G.729 Licensing.
* G.729 licenses are [now available](http://www.freeswitch.org/node/235) for Linux systems.
* The Windows version is [in testing](http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-dev/2010-June/003880.html).
* Add [OPAL](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fopal "Mod opal") support for improved [H.323](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fh323 "Mod h323").
* Stabilize and branch FreeSWITCH 1.0 “Phoenix".
* Complete and release FreeSWITCH 1.2 “Dragon".
* Release FreeSWITCH 1.4 "Gandalf"
