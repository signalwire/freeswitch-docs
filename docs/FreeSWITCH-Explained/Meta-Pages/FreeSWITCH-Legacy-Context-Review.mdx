# FreeSWITCH Docs Legacy Context Review

## About

As FreeSWITCH has evolved, so has its documentation. The collective knowledge of the community has
transitioned through various platforms and phases. This review focuses on legacy comments and content 
that originated from our migration from a Confluence wiki to Docusaurus.

### Goals

This document aims to streamline documentation content while preserving valuable historical information.

> I think the title is appropriate because the flow chart does shows the life cycles of both legs of a call, from start to finish, which is basically a call. In CS_NEW, the A leg channel is created, and in CS_EXECUTE (depending on the dialplan instructions) a B leg channel will also be created. Could be wrong.

> When you see different values when you run show calls and show channels from the CLI, it is because show calls only counts bridged callsNot quite true. A call that is ringing shows up multiple times in "show calls", once for the inbound channel and once each for all the outbound channels.
