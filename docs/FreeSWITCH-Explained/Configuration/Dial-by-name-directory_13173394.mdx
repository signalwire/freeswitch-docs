### Concept

The script prompts the caller to enter the user they are trying to reach, last name/first name. The caller enters letters until a unique match is made, then the user is transferred to that user.

### Installation

* Since this is a javascript app, mod\_spidermonkey must be configured and enabled.
* Copy `dial\_by\_name\_directory.js` to `${freeswitch\_base\_dir}/scripts`
* copy `dial\_by\_name\_directory.xml` to somewhere `${freeswitch\_base\_dir}/conf/lang/en`, and ensure the directory it is in gets included by `en.xml`

### Usage

From the dialplan:

```xml
<extension name="dial_by_name">
	<condition field="destination_number" expression="^6000$">
		<action application="javascript" data="dial_by_name_directory.js" />
	</condition>
</extension>
```

or, from an IVR:

```xml
<entry action="menu-exec-app" digits="9" param="javascript dial_by_name_directory.js"/>
```
