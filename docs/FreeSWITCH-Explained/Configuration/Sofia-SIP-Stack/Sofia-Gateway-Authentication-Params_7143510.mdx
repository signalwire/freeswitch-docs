## About

Params for configuring Sofia gateway authentication.

### Gateway Authentication

Here are all the possible values for a gateway:

**register** _true or false_ (like when you don't want to register but want to auth to a gateway)

**schema** (Currently should be left blank which is Digest by default)

**realm** (authorization realm in some cases you might need to set this)

**username** (this is the authorization and from username in the registration unless from-user is set.)

**auth-username** (this will be the authentication username for an outbound registration)

**password** (well the password)

**caller-id-in-from** (for those times the callerid is in the from for when the remote doesn't do rpid or p-asserted)

**extension** (this is the contact extension for the remote to contact)

**extension-in-contact** (this will send the extension in the SIP Contact header)

**proxy** (defaults to the gateway name unless you set this param)

**context** (what context this gateway is in)

**expire-seconds** (how many seconds to register for default is 3600 if left empty)

**retry-seconds** (this sets the number of seconds to retry the registration)

**from-user** (the username used in the from field defaults to the username if left empty)

**from-domain** (the domain to use in the from field)

**register-proxy** (for those times you have a proxy you register with and a different proxy to send calls to defaults to gateway name or proxy if left empty)

**contact-params** (extra contact params ie tport=tcp)

**register-transport** (udp,tcp or tls if you have it enabled)

  
### Comments:

| Missing from this list is **outbound-proxy**, used to route outbound calls. If you use just **proxy** that will override **realm** and auth will fail if realm is required and is different to proxy. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by dcw67 at Aug 18, 2020 20:33                                                                                 |

| Point well taken, however I only see it being read from config files in sofia.c and mod\_sofia.c and not really used anywhere, but I am by no means a C guru. Further, the Vanilla example.xml gateway file on github doesn't mention it, so I'm not sure it's fully developed yet? ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at Oct 23, 2020 17:49 |
