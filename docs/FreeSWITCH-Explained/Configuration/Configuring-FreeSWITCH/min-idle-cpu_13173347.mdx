## About

min-idle-cpu specifies the minimum CPU idle time below which FreeSWITCH will refuse additional calls.

## min-idle-cpu

Used in: autoload\_configs/switch.conf.xml  

min-idle-cpu reserves the specified percentage of CPU idle time for other processes. This setting avoids exhausting CPU time for processes other than FreeSWITCH. If min-idle-cpu is set to 25 and FreeSWITCH processing causes the CPU idle time to drop below 25%, then FreeSWITCH will refuse to process additional calls in order to allow other processes to have sufficient CPU time available.
