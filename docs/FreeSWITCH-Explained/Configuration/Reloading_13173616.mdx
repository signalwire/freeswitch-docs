# Reloading 

 

## Introduction

When is a **reloadxml** sufficient for "reloading and moving on"? This can be a tricky question. Sometimes reloading XML is sufficient. Sometimes more is needed.

## Discussion

When making updates in FreeSWITCH it is frequently necessary to "reload" in order for the changes to take effect. Sometimes you need to issue just the **reloadxml** command, as with updating XML dialplan files. However, there are times when you need to do something in addition to reloading XML. Further complicating matters, there are some commands that will execute a reloadxml on your behalf so that you don't explicitly have to issue two commands!

Below is a list of items that require various types of reloading. (If you see something that isn't on this list then by all means add it if you know it.) For example, it mentions the **reloadacl** command. The reloadacl command performs a reloadxml for you and then updates the ACLs in the system. Also, the **reload \<module\_name>** command now performs a reloadxml for you as well. (This was added in mid 2012 and it available on all recent versions of FreeSWITCH.)
