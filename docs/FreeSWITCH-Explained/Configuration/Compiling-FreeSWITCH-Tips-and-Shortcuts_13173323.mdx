## Introduction

This page contains useful tips on how the different Makefile options can help you with compiling.

## Discussion

Compiling FreeSWITCH requires compiling lots of libraries and lots of files in various sub-directories. Sometimes you need to compile just certain parts of FreeSWITCH. Other times you want to start from scratch. The options listed below will help.

## Options

* make clean - Cleans the build environment
* make current - Cleans build environment, performs an git update, then does a make install
* make core\_install (or make install\_core) - Recompiles and installs just the core files. Handy if you are working on a core file and want to recompile without doing the whole shebang.
* make mod\_XXXX-install - Recompiles and installs just a single module. Here are some examples:  
   * make mod\_openzap-install  
   * make mod\_sofia-install  
   * make mod\_lcr-install
* make samples - This will not replace your configuration. This will instead make the default extensions and dialplan to run the basic configuration of FreeSWITCH.
