```xml
14:52 <@SwK> hey say your cacti graphs on FB... mind sharing how you did that?
14:52 <@SwK> not putting 'em on face book but setting up cacti to do the calls
14:53 < Cherebrum> well... you click "Share Link" on facebook...
14:53 <@SwK> Cherebrum, I know how to share a link of facebook I mean sharing with the rest of the world how you got cacti to graph the calls
14:55 < Cherebrum> SwK: In /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:  exec fscalls /usr/local/bin/fscalls.sh
14:55 < Cherebrum> in /usr/local/bin/fscalls.sh: /usr/local/bin/fs_cli -x 'show calls count'|grep '\d* total.'|cut -d" " -f1
14:56 < Cherebrum> then: snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8 -On
14:56 < Cherebrum> and find your OID and graph that OID
14:56 < Cherebrum> Then... on facebook, click Share Link...
