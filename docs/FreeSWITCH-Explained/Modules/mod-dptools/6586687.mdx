## 0\. About

Places a channel "on hold" in the switch, instead of in the phone.

Parking a call does **NOT** supply music on hold or any other media.

Park is quite literally a way to put a call in limbo until you

* bridge it (with [mod\_dptools: bridge](./6586484.mdx#45-user) or `uuid_bridge` in [mod\_commands](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx)))
or
* transfer it (via [mod\_dptools: transfer](./6586616.mdx#about) or `uuid_transfer` in [mod\_commands](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx))).

Allows for a number of different options, including:

* Set caller in a place where the channel won't be hung up on while waiting for someone to talk to.
* Generic "hold" mechanism until you can connect it to the right person.

Please note that to retrieve a call that has been "parked", you'll have to [bridge](./6586484.mdx#45-user) to them or transfer the call to a valid location.

TODO Couldn't find any instructions how to do that, so probably via the channel's UUID? 

## 1\. Usage

### 1.1 From the Dialplan

```xml
<action application="park"/>
```

Note that the park application takes no arguments, so the data attribute can be omitted in the definition.
