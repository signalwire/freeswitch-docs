# About

Permits proper answering of multiple simultaneous calls to the same pickup group.

Basically the pickup endpoint is a dummy channel that never answers to which you can originate from anywhere you can place calls. Call it alone or place it in a list for a forked dial.

* 2 [Example](#example)

## Usage

```xml
pickup/keyname
pickup+keyname
```

## Example

```xml
originate sofia/internal/100@test.com,pickup/mygroup
```

OR for multiple groups:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="${sofia_contact(100@test.com)},pickup/mygroup,pickup/mygroup2"/>
```

Now the pickup channel will be created alongside the sip channel.

From another call route the call to the application pickup with data "mygroup" to have your channel return from originate

```xml
<action application="pickup" data="mygroup"/>
```

When you place that call, your session will be returned from the originate in place of the pickup/mygroup call being placed.

It also works with presence so you could assign blf buttons to it.

```xml
pickup+mygroup
```

The group names can also have an @domain.com for multihoming etc.

Note that whilst the name of the pickup group can be alphanumeric, it may make more sense to use numeric groups so that they can be picked up from an extensions such as follows:

```xml
<extension name="group_pickup">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^\*57(\d+)$">
    <action application="pickup" data="$1"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

When a user dials \*57nnn, a call belonging to pickup group &lt;nnn> will be picked up.
