## About

  
Answer the call for a channel.This sets up duplex audio between the calling ''A'' leg and the FreeSwitch server. It is not about other endpoints.

  
The server might need to 'answer' a call to play an audio file or to receive DTMF from the call.

Once answered, calls can still be bridged to other extensions. Because a bridge after an answer is actually a transfer, the ringback tones sent to the caller will be defined by `transfer_ringback`.

## Example

  
```xml
<action application="answer"/>
```

### Play a tone

A simple example to answer in order to play a 1004kc test tone to the caller, then hangup.

```xml
	<extension name="play tone">
		<condition field="destination_number" expression="^tone1$">
			<action application="log" data="INFO *****Playing tone1***** "/>
			<action application="answer"/>
			<action application="sleep" data="1000"/>
			<action application="playback" data="tone_stream://v=-6;%(10000,100,1004);loops=1"/>
			<action application="hangup"/>
		</condition>
	</extension>


```

  
### Answer a call to detect FAX tones

We need to answer the call to let FreeSWITCH receive the audio to start detecting FAX tones. Because a bridge after an answer is actually a transfer, the ringback sent to the caller is now defined by transfer\_ringback

```xml
  <extension name="sales_fax">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^sales_fax$"> 
      <action application="answer"/>
      <action application="set" data="transfer_ringback=${us-ring}"/>
      <action application="spandsp_start_fax_detect" data="transfer 'FAX XML default' 6"/>
      <action application="bridge" data="${group_call(sales@${domain_name})}"/>
    </condition>
  </extension>
```
