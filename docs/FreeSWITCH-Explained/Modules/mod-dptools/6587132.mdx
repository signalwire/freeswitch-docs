## 0\. About

You can use `start_dtmf` in a dialplan to enable in-band DTMF detection (i.e. the detection of DTMF tones on a channel). You should do this when you want to be able to identify DTMF tones on a channel that doesn't otherwise support another signaling method (like RFC2833 or INFO).

A, B, C, D tones

Make sure to expect (and handle) the DTMF tones `A` , `B` , `C` , and `D`; these are very rare nowadays but they are still possible to send (e.g., someone has an old device with the extra ABCD column). See [DTMF](../../Configuration/DTMF_9634268.mdx#5-other) for more.

TODO [RFC 2833](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2833) is obsoleted by [RFC 4733](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4733).

## 1\. Example

```xml
<!-- a sample IVR -->
<extension name="ivr_demo">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="5000">
    <action application="answer"/>
    <action application="start_dtmf" />
    <action application="ivr" data="demo_ivr"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

  
The `start_dtmf` line listed above starts the `start_dtmf` application on this channel to allow for DTMF detection.

Do not use the `start_dtmf` application and the [mod\_dptools: start\_dtmf\_generate](./6587137.mdx#0-about) application together. If both are running at the same time you will cause a feedback loop to occur within FreeSWITCH itself, such that a DTMF tone from a caller will result in repetitive DTMF tones being identified by FreeSWITCH.

If using in conjunction with `ring_ready`, make sure that `ring_ready` is called first or else it may not work.

This application uses Media BUG.
