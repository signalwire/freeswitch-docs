# mod_dptools: transfer 

 

## About

Immediately transfer the calling channel to a new context. If there happens to be an xml extension named \<destination\_number> then control is "warped" directly to that extension. Otherwise it goes through the entire context checking for a match.

TODO What is the difference between `uuid_transfer` in [mod\_commands](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx)) and [mod\_dptools: transfer](./6586616.mdx#about)?

## Description

Immediately transfer the calling channel to a new context. If there happens to be an xml extension named \<destination\_number> then control is "warped" directly to that extension. Otherwise it goes through the entire context checking for a match.

Example: say caller dials 3015551212, causing conf/dialplan/public/3015551212.xml to "answer". If 3015551212.xml does an:

```xml
<action application="transfer" data="1047 XML cntxt_a"/>
```

that causes the conf/dialplan/cntxt\_a/1047.xml to be parsed (assuming that file does a match on "^1047$". If dialplan or context are not defined, they default to XML and default.

The transfer app does not actually "transfer a call" (It might have been better named _dialplan-jump_). It changes the destination extension and/or context and restarts the parsing of the dialplan. Actual transfers are done after a call is answered by use of the bridge application. see [bridge](./6586484.mdx#45-user).

Each transfer app call will decrement max\_forwards variable that is by default set to 70\. After 70 transfers the call will go on-hook. If you have a large IVR dialplan application, to prevent call going on-hook, you can set max\_session\_transfers variable to a large value. Once max\_session\_transfers is defined for a channel, max\_forwards is not touched by transfer application, and the value in max\_session\_transfers gets decremented.

## Usage

```xml
transfer <destination_number> [<dialplan> [<context>]]
```

## Examples

```xml
<action application="transfer" data="500"/>
```

This example is found in public.xml. It transfers the call to the given extension in the default context, which is located in default.xml. Please note the use of XML as a dialplan as it is defined in freeswitch.xml

```xml
<extension name="public_extensions">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(10[01][0-9])$">
    <action application="transfer" data="$1 XML default"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

If the call is currently in a bridge it will transfer the other side of the call instead of itself:

```xml
<action application="transfer" data="-bleg 2103"/>
```

This would transfer both legs of the call to the same ext. i.e a conference extension:

```xml
<action application="transfer" data="-both 2103"/>
```

When a call is transferred back through the dialplan, the RDNIS value is populated with the previous destination\_number value.

**Note:** You can also specify an [inline dialplan](./6586667.mdx#about)

**Note:** Transfer will begin parsing extensions from the beginning of the dialplan. Be careful to avoid loops.

**Note:** The transfer application also works with **mod\_xml\_curl**, it just does another request to mod\_xml\_curl and starts over again, just like in the static dialplan.

  
### Comments:

| In lua, try session:getVariable("max\_session\_transfers") got nil.How can I get the channel variable **max\_session\_transfers** ?

| Initially max\_session\_transfers is not set. You need to set it to a numeric value; only then this variable going to be decremented instead of max\_forwards. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by tomasb at Apr 23, 2019 14:59                                                                          |
| it transfers to extension with name="\<destination\_number>" or to file with name=\<destination\_number>.xml ? ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by clx88 at Mar 09, 2021 00:22                                                                                                                             |
| Yeah, that example is just plain wrong, unless I'm misunderstanding it. It transfers the session to search for the desired extension in another \<dialplan name>.xml which is NOT named after the number. So there is no 3015551212.xml ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by boteman at Mar 11, 2021 14:28 |
