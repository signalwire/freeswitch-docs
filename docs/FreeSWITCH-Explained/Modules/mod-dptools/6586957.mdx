## Usage

If you are trying to detect fax tones, using [mod\_spandsp spandsp\_start\_fax\_detect](../mod_spandsp_6587021.mdx)) is recommended.

Updated, preferred behavior:

```xml
<action application="set" data="execute_on_tone_detect=set my_tone=true"/>
<action application="set" data="tone_detect_hits=2"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_media=tone_detect mytone 820 w +30000"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/foo/123456789"/>
```

This method will execute the application immediately. If you actually like to run the app async on the media stream specify this:

```xml
<action application="set" data="execute_on_tone_detect=set::mytone=true"/>
```

Older, still working behavior:

```xml
<action application="tone_detect" data="<key> <freqs> <flags> <timeout> <app> <data> <hits>">
```

## Notes:

* ## Once tone_detect is triggered, it won't be triggered again ''unless'' you have specified the "hits" argument in which case it will only get triggered once the "hits" count has been reached
* Only "key" and "frequencies" are required (the rest are optional)
* If you want to catch the DETECTED\_TONE event with the channel-uuid use something like this:

```xml
<action application="tone_detect" data="fax 1100 r +8000 '''set fax=true''' 2">
```

## Variables

### execute_on_tone_detect

Specifies the application and arguments to be executed when the tone\_detect application gets a positive detection. This represents the new, preferred behavior for using tone\_detect. However, the older method will still work.

```xml
<action application="set" data="execute_on_tone_detect=found_my_tone=true"/>
<action application="set" data="tone_detect_hits=2"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_media=tone_detect mytone 820 w +30000"/>
```

### tone_detect_hits

Specifies the number of "hits" that the tone\_detect app needs to see before considering a positive detection. This represents the new, preferred behavior for using tone\_detect. However, the older method will still work.

```xml
<action application="set" data="execute_on_tone_detect=found_my_tone=true"/>
<action application="set" data="tone_detect_hits=2"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_media=tone_detect mytone 820 w +30000"/>
```

## Comments

Some of the advanced knowledge about tone\_detect is actually found in this nice little IRC exchange with anthm and MikeJ.

```xml
<MikeJ> <action application="tone_detect" data="test 350,440 r +100 hangup 'normal_clearing' 1"/>
<MikeJ> test is name, freqs, +100 is timeout I think..
<MikeJ> anthm?
<trixter_> test I assume is the name of the tone, what is r+100? and is hangup normal_clearing the action to do once you get it?
<anthm> <key> <freqs> [<flags> <timeout> <app> <data>]
<anthm> flags r and w
<anthm> for which way you want to sniff
<trixter_> ok.. 
<anthm> everything after freqs is optional
<anthm> default is "r'
<MikeJ> timeout in secs ? and allways need the + ?
<anthm> with + is relative to now
<anthm> w/o is absolute
<MikeJ> and if you dont specify app.. you just get event, right/
<MikeJ> ?
<anthm> right
<anthm> once it's tripped it wont anymore
<anthm> but you can reset it with just key
<anthm> if you call one with only key name and it already exists it will reactivate it
<MikeJ> just app.. or api too?
<anthm> key is arbitrary and just what you get in the event
<anthm> app and api are identical but api needs uuid too as first arg and all the other are shifted 1 to the right
<anthm> it won't let you decide that
<anthm> =D
<anthm> once you use it at all it adds 1
<anthm> and if you call it again it just adds more to the same 1
```

### Detect 3 consecutive busy tones any time during a call and hangup when detected.

```xml
<action application="tone_detect" data="busy 425 r 0 hangup 'normal_clearing' 3"/>
```

### How to use tone_detect and originate for automatic test calls to detect missing or corrupt audio.

On B side of the call simply answer the call and do echo loopback. The A side of the call like below. Control is done by external script that does "originate", "show calls", "uuid\_kill" and "uuid\_dump". You can even make your script collect tcpdump for you based on IP:port from "uuid\_dump".

```xml
<!-- Use originate to start a test call here -->
<extension name="test_tone_init">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^test_tone_init$">
    <action application="set" data="pass_counter=0"/>
    <action application="transfer" data="test_tone"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
<!-- 
This extension will be executed 10 times. If 10 cycles were Ok, it means no issue reproduced. Test call ends.
If test tone is not detected for consequtive number of hits, it means a bad call. Dailplan execution goes to the last two instructions and stays there forever. 
This allows external script to detect bad call based on "show calls" and do uuid_dump for such call(s) 
-->
<extension name="test_tone">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^test_tone$"/>
  <condition field="${pass_counter}" expression="^[0-9]$">
    <action application="set" data="pass_counter=${expr(${pass_counter}+1)}"/>
    <action application="tone_detect" data="tone_1 1004 r 0 transfer 'test_tone' 28"/>
    <action application="playback" data="tone_stream://%(18000,0,1004);loops=1"/>
    <!-- this is only triggered if tone_detect failed in one of the previous loops -->
    <action application="stop_tone_detect"/>
    <!-- sit here and do playback forever -->
    <action application="playback" data="tone_stream://%(18000,0,1004);loops=-1"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```
