# mod_dptools: set zombie exec 

 

## About

Sets the zombie execution flag on the current channel. If the channel is hung up the session will continue executing commands. Useful for additional post call processing (ex: where you would still need access to channel variables).

## Usage

```xml
set_zombie_exec 
```

## Example

```xml
<action application="set_zombie_exec"/> 
```

 In a Lua script:

```xml
session:execute("set_zombie_exec")
```
