 Created by  Luan Fonseca de Farias, last modified by  Bipin on 2018.08.16

## About

Allows one channel to bridge itself to the a or b leg of another call. The remaining leg of the original call gets hungup (or does this only happen with hangup\_after\_bridge?)

* 2 [Examples](#examples)
* 3 [Intercept additional variables](#intercept-additional-variables)

## Usage

```xml
intercept [-bleg] <uuid>
```

## Examples

```xml
<action application="intercept" data="myUUID"/>
```

To intercept the b leg of the call:

```xml
<action application="intercept" data="-bleg myUUID"/> 
```

Via sendmsg on the event socket:

```xml
sendmsg <the uuid of the channel you want to control (inbound leg) >
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: intercept
execute-app-arg: <the uuid of the call you want to bridge to (outbound leg)
```

## Intercept additional variables

To intercept only if the call is not bridged (available since git-58fe45a):

```xml
<action application="set" data="intercept_unbridged_only=true"/>
<action application="intercept" data="myUUID"/>
```

To intercept only if the call was not answered:

```xml
<action application="set" data="intercept_unanswered_only=true"/>
<action application="intercept" data="myUUID"/>
```

intercept\_unbridged\_only is useful e.g. in scenarious where the initial call has been answered and transferred and is ringing at the transfered extensions. With intercept\_unanswered\_only=true this call could no longer be intercepted, but with intercept\_unbridged\_only=true it still can be.

### Comments:

| The first example of intercept unbridgedonly should contain intercept\_unbridged\_only not intercept\_unanswered\_only.Thanks ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by ra at ago 28, 2015 06:05 |
