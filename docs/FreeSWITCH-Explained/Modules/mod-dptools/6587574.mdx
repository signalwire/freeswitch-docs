# mod_dptools: check_acl 

 

## About

Block originating address unless it matches an ACL.Test the i.p. address that originates the call against an Access Control List or CIDR mask and terminate the call if the originating address does not match. If it matches, the call proceeds through the remainder of the dialplan.

## Usage

check_acl \<ip> \<acl | cidr> [\<hangup_cause>]

inline=yes, this application may be run inline from the XML dialplan.

hangup\_cause defaults to call\_rejected (see [Hangup Causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about))

## Examples

\<action application="check_acl" data="$\{network_addr} foo normal_clearing"/>

A call originating from an i.p. address that is not listed in the Access Control List named "foo" will be terminated with cause code "normal\_clearing".

\<action application="check_acl" data="$\{network_addr} 1.2.3.0/8 normal_clearing" inline="true"/>

A call originating from i.p. address 1.2.3.4 will match the CIDR specified and continue the pass through the dialplan.

A call originating from i.p. address 4.3.2.1 will not match the CIDR specified and be terminated immediately because the inline flag is set to "true". There will be no further dialplan processing after this application is executed.
