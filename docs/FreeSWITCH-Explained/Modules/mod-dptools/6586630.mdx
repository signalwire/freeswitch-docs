## About

This application adds/deletes groups to/from the db(internal db or [ODBC](../../Databases/ODBC-DSN/Using-ODBC-in-the-core_6586653.mdx)) and allows calls to these groups in conjunction with the [bridge](./6586484.mdx#45-user)\-application. Depends on mod\_db and mod\_dptools.

### Usage

```xml
group,[insert|delete|call]:<group name>:<url>,group [insert|delete|call]
```

### Examples

The default dialplan uses these commands for add-group, del-group, and the call-group extensions in conf/dialplan/default.xml

On the CLI, to add an external number (i.e. a mobile) to a call group:

```xml
group insert:01@example.com:sofia/gateway/provider/0123456789
```

This would add to group ''01'' (as callable via 8201) assuming that the local domain set in vars.xml is ''[example.com](http://example.com)'', that the gateway name is ''provider'' and the number to dial is ''0123456789''

If you need to set a channel variable, you can do this thus:

```xml
group insert:01@example.com:[sip_cid_type=none]sofia/gateway/provider/0123456789
```

Deleting group members is of course possible with group delete, but (as far as I know) it's not possible to list the members of a group via the CLI, so you might be better off using SQL. If you're using the default sqlite setup, you'll need to install sqlite, and then you'll be able to point that at the file ''db/call\_limit.db'' thus:

```xml
sqlite3 db/call_limit.db
```

and then you can do things like:

```xml
select * from group_data;
```

to list all group members, to empty a group you could use:

```xml
delete from group_data where groupname = '01@example.com';
```
