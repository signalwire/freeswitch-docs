## About

Implements speech recognition.

## Usage

```xml
detect_speech <mod_name> <gram_name> <gram_path> [<addr>]
detect_speech grammar <gram_name> [<path>]
detect_speech grammaron <gram_name>
detect_speech grammaroff <gram_name>
detect_speech grammarsalloff
detect_speech nogrammar <gram_name>
detect_speech param <name> <value>
detect_speech pause
detect_speech resume
detect_speech start_input_timers
detect_speech stop
```

## Examples

### Speech Recognition Via the Event Socket

Start the recognizer and select a grammar in one shot:

```xml
SendMsg e2d1c628-f32c-4497-b813-7474ce406317
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: detect_speech
execute-app-arg:pocketsphinx yesno yesno
```

You should see DETECTED\_SPEECH events with "Speech-Type: begin-speaking" when the recognizer notices the start of speech. For example: (using "plain" events)

```xml
Content-Length: 1605
Content-Type: text/event-plain

If recognition is successful, you should also see a DETECTED\_SPEECH event with "Speech-Type: detected-speech" and some XML describing what was detected. For example:

```xml
Content-Length: 1791
Content-Type: text/event-plain

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<result grammar="holdr">
<interpretation grammar="yesno" confidence="98">
<input mode="speech">YES</input>
</interpretation>
</result>
```

Note: The XML body at the end there with our result has a Content-Length of 165\. That is included as part of the overall count of 1791 at the beginning.

### Playing Prompts

It is common to play prompts while detecting speech. Making a change like this to the media will pause the recognizer. For example, if you start to play a file:

```xml
SendMsg ad375c14-ba41-46c8-b800-4aa2ef295bba
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: playback
execute-app-arg: say-yes-or-no.wav
```

you should immediately resume the recognizer:

```xml
SendMsg e2d1c628-f32c-4497-b813-7474ce406317
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: detect_speech
execute-app-arg: resume
```

Recognition will happen while the file is playing. You will need to have \[\[Mod\_event\_socket#divert\_events|divert\_events\]\] on to receive the ASR events while the file is being played.

### Detecting Multiple Phrases

Each start of the recognizer detects only one phrase so if you want a somewhat continuous recognition, you will need to resume the recognizer after each successful recognition as well.

When you are done, you'll want to stop the recognizer to save precious CPU cycles:

```xml
SendMsg e2d1c628-f32c-4497-b813-7474ce406317
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: detect_speech
execute-app-arg: stop
```
