## Description

Three way is implemented using [eavesdrop](./6586529.mdx#--) and therefore DTMF signals sent by the third party will have the same affect.

## Usage

```xml
<action application="three_way" data="<any uuid of a bridged call>"/>
```

Or with [mod\_event\_socket](../mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl):

```xml
SendMsg <barge-in initiator uuid>
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: three_way

```
