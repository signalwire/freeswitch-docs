## About

Event application can be used to fire aribtrary events.

## Usage

```xml
Event Event-Name=$event_name[,Event-Subclass=$event_subclass][,header=value,header=value]
```

This application may be run _[inline](../../Dialplan/index.mdx#modules)_ from the XML dialplan.

## Examples

by [Pawel Pierscionek](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/~urtho)

```xml
<action application="event" data="Event-Subclass=myevent::notify,Event-Name=CUSTOM,key1=value1,key2=value2"/>
```

I find it useful in driving inbound event socket finite state machines that do not subscribe to CHANNEL\_EXECUTE\* events yet need signals when some actions of [inline dialplans](../../Dialplan/Inline-Dialplan_13173434.mdx#escaping) are completed. Eg: fire a custom notification that a file has been played and the channel is now waiting for more instructions while the customer listens to MOH.

```xml
<extension name="ACDIntro">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^queue_beta$">
    <action application="set" data="acd_line_ext=150"/>
    <action application="answer" />
    <action application="playback" data="intro.wav" />
    <action application="event" data="Event-Subclass=VoiceWorks.pl::ACDnotify,Event-Name=CUSTOM,state=Intro,condition=IntroPlayed"/>
    <action application="playback" data="local_stream://moh" />
  </condition>
</extension>
```

This is how such an event appears on the wire:

```xml
Core-UUID: 1ebe7b98-1533-11de-a612-0b68f08ca0e3
FreeSWITCH-Hostname: acd2.urtho.dev
FreeSWITCH-IPv4: 192.168.0.144
[...]
Event-Subclass: VoiceWorks.pl%3A%3AACDnotify
Event-Name: CUSTOM
state: Intro
condition: IntroPlayed
```

If you wish to schedule an event to be triggered from a dialplan, you can use the following approach:

```xml
<action application="set" data="api_result=${sched_api(+5 ${uuid} uuid_broadcast ${uuid} event::Event-Subclass=myevent-notify,Event-Name=CUSTOM)}"/>
```
