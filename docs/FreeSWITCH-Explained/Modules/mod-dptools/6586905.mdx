# mod_dptools: regex 

 

## About

Executes a [Regular Expression](../../Examples/Regular-Expression/index.mdx).

Technically this is not a dialplan application but rather an API. API's are normally done at the CLI, however using the $\{my\_api(my\_args)} syntax with the ''set'' application allows for the use of many API's inside the dialplan itself.

### Usage

```xml
regex value expression results*
```

(results is optional, without this argument the regex returns true or false)

You can test your dialplan on the FS console like this.

```xml
regex 61555555555|^61([0-9]{9})$|0%1 
```

This would return 0555555555.

```xml
regex 61555555555|^61([0-9]{9})$
```

This would return true.

### Parameters

* value = string to run regex against
* expression = the actual regular expression
* results = result handling string ( optional. without the regex returns true / false )

In your results string, you can not use $0 $1 $2 $3 as you normally would, as they would contain the results of your "condition" expression.

So inline Regex's use %0 %1 %2 %3 as their format.

If you want to use pipes as an logical OR in regular expressions you must escape them, because the regex command already uses pipes to separate parameters.

```xml
regex 9999|^(1234\|9999)$
```

This would return true.

### Examples

Modify an Australian E164 caller\_id to 0NSN format.

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=${regex(${caller_id_number}|^61([0-9]{9})$|0%1)}"/>
```
