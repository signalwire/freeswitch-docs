# mod_dptools: hangup 


## 0\. About

Hangs up a channel, with an optional cause code supplied.

## 1\. Usage

```xml
<action application="hangup" data="USER_BUSY"/>
```

If you use hangup after a bridge, FreeSWITCH™ overrides the cause with the cause received from the bridge application. You can avoid this using sip\_ignore\_remote\_cause=true

## 2\. Troubleshooting

These tips have been shared by [Bao Nguyen](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/~nttranbao) 

### 2.1 [A leg](../../Introduction/Call-Legs.mdx#0-about) wouldn't disconnect after calling `hangup` 

Did you see the `BYE` sent by FreeSWITCH™ towards the caller, and its 200 OK response? If yes, then it's the problem with your ITSP or the caller cell provider.

[hangup\_after\_bridge](../../../Channel-Variables-Catalog/hangup_after_bridge_16352708.mdx) variable is also worth checking when FreeSWITCH™ didn't hang up the A leg when B is terminated.
