## Usage

```xml
<action application="cng_plc"/>
```

## Problem Case

When experiencing intermittent dropped packets, it could be that the packets are probably late and being dropped and replaced with silence.

You can try 2 things:

1. run the app cng\_plc before bridge and in execute\_on\_originate on the B-leg.  
```xml  
<action application="cng_plc"/>  
```
2. enable the jitter buffer at a small value by setting jitterbuffer\_msec=60  
```xml  
<action application="set" data="jitterbuffer_msec=60"/>  
```
