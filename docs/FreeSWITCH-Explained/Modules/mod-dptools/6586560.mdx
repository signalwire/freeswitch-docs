# mod_dptools: endless_playback 

 

## About

This application is used to play a file endlessly and the playing **cannot be stopped** externally.

## Usage

```xml
<action application="endless_playback" data="filename"/>
```

## Notes

Call control events, particularly hangup, will terminate endless playback. DTMF detection will not interrupt endless playback.

The [pause](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx#pause) API command will pause playback generated by this app.

The [uuid\_break](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx#uuid_break) API command will restart playback from the beginning of the file, but will not terminate playback.
