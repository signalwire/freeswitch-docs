## About

Sends an info packet with a sipfrag. If the phone supports it will show message on the display.


## Usage

```xml
send_display <message>
```

## Example

```xml
<action application="send_display" data="Hello world"/>
```

## Compatibility List

### Polycom

Tested on a soundpoint 670 running sip 3.0.4\. Works fine on Polycom. Display text shows up in 'placed calls', seems to be intended for sending the name of the called party to the caller.  
Can send only one message to the display before answer. After call is answered, the display message can be updated at will. Call list record will show last message sent.

### Snom 3xx

Works fine

### Nokia

Call hangs up when it gets the message.
