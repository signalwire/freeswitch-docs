# mod_dptools: detect_silence 

 

## About

Pause dialplan execution while waiting for a certain length of silence on the channel. When silence is detected, or when the timeout period has expired, dialplan processing will continue.

## Usage

```xml
detect_silence <silence_thresh> <silence_hits> <timeout> [<file>]
```

  
## Description

This function is similar to the [wait\_for\_silence](./6586879.mdx#about) function except this does not require noise hits before listening for silence

"Silence" is determined by a combination of the \<silence\_thresh> value and the \<silence\_hits> value.

* The silence\_thresh value is the silence threshold. The lower the value, the "quieter" the channel must be in order to be considered in a silent state. A larger value allows louder sound received from the endpoint to be treated as silence.
* The silence\_hits value represents the number of consecutive frames received with an "energy level" below the silence\_thresh value that must be seen before the channel is considered in a silent state. The higher this value, the longer the channel must be in a "silent" state before silence is detected.
* The \<timeout\_ms> value represents the overall time in milliseconds that the wait\_for\_silence app will attempt to detect silence before ending the wait and moving on to the next dialplan line.
* \<file> is an optional sound file that can be read and analyzed for silence detection.

## Dialplan Example

```xml
<action application="detect_silence" data="200 15 5000"/>
```
