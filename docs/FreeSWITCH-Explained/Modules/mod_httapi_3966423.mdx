## About

This module provides an HTTP based Telephony API using a standard FreeSWITCH application interface as well as a cached http file format interface.

This module is designed to programmatically control the handling of inbound calls. When the HTTAPI application is
executed, it initiates an HTTP request to a specified URL and waits for a response. The response includes instructions.
After executing these instructions, HTTAPI will initiate another request. This cycle
continues until either the call is disconnected or the HTTAPI application is terminated through a 'break' instruction.

## Usage

 The application is called like this:

```xml
<action application="httapi" data="http://some.host.com/app.cgi"/>
```

We can pass additional parameters to the application like this:

```xml
<action application="httapi" data="{httpapi_profile=foo,method=POST,url=http://some.host.com/app.cgi}"/>
```

By default, HTTP GET request is used. Using method parameter as show above we can change it to POST.

### Response format

The response from the HTTP server is expected to be in XML format, with content type set to `text/xml`.

**Note**: If content type is not set to `text/xml` then application will throw an error and try again infinitely.

The format is roughly as described below (We could use a DTD maybe).

```xml
<document type="xml/freeswitch-httapi">
 <params>
   <someparam>someval</someparam>
 </params>
 <variables>
   <somevar>someval</somevar>
 </variables>
 <work>
 <...>
 </work>
</document>
```

The profile name must be chosen to bind to a preset series of settings and permissions to use as a basis for the client session. It's chosen from the specified params or from the channel variable using the keyname 'httapi\_profile' and if not specified will default to 'default' Any params specified in the initial data of the application encased in curly braces {} will be parsed into the initial parameters similar to originate. These params remain set until the call ends and are supplied as form elements on each hit to the HTTP server. If the permissions allow, a &lt;params> tag is parsed from the resulting document and set into this data set and will be mirrored back on subsequent http posts. Also, if the permissions allow, a &lt;variables> tag is parsed the same way to set channel variables. The &lt;work> tag is required and contains one or more of the supported command tags that generally manipulate the call behavior. The application will continue to do the task in the work section until an error is encountered or when an action from the work tag warrants it. If the session exits the httapi app without hanging up it can do other tasks and make another call to httapi and the session data will remain preserved.

### Example

```xml
<document type="xml/freeswitch-httapi">
 <params></params>
 <work>
  <playback name="exten" file="http://my.com/sounds/exten.wav" error-file="http://my.com/sounds/invalid.wav" input-timeout="5000">
   <bind strip="#">~\d+#</bind>
  </playback>
 </work>
</document>
```

  
Note that the value from bind strip is returned to the same page as the parameter exten (taken from name in playback).

### Binding

Several of the work tags that indicate they support bindings can contain one or more bind tags that function in similar fashion to bind\_digit\_action

```xml
<bind action strip>*EXPR*</bind>
ATTRS:
action              : a specific url to go to next if the binding is dialed
strip               : a character to strip from the result string, such as #
```

NOTE : Srigg reported that multiple &lt;bind strip> tags are needed when you want it to post digits after the timeout expired (in fact, as many tags as the quantity of digits expected)

## Answer and Early Media

### When to answer

You don't need to answer the call in the dialplan before calling into httapi. These both extensions below will make httapi requests to my application:

```xml
   <extension name="test1">
       <condition field="destination_number" expression="^6622$">
           <action application="httapi" data="{url=http://localhost/simver/FSHttApi/Test}" />
       </condition>
   </extension>
   
   <extension name="test2">
       <condition field="destination_number" expression="^6621$">
           <action application="answer" />
           <action application="httapi" data="{url=http://localhost/simver/FSHttApi/Test}" />
       </condition>
   </extension>
```

You can play back sounds or 'say' something without explicitly 'answering' the call. But the call is early media only and in this state you won't be able to collect dtmf, for example. If you want to interact with the call you have to answer then since early media is an intermediate state and doesn't mean the call will stay alive for much long.

### Answering calls

You can answer the call with &lt;application name="answer"/> but by default there's no permission to run the 'answer' application from httapi script so you need to enable it in httapi.conf.xml.
