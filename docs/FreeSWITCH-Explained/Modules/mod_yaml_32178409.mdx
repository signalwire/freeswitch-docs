# `mod_yaml`

:::info[INFO <sup><sup>(in lieu of any official documentation)</sup></sup>]
Seems to have been created as a jest in response to criticism regarding XML being used as the default configuration language. See the [Q: XML sucks! Do I have any other options?](../Miscellaneous/FAQ/index.mdx#xml-sucks) section in the [FAQ](../Miscellaneous/FAQ/index.mdx) for more.

The [source of <span class="fs-mod-names">mod_yaml</span>](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/tree/master/src/mod/languages/mod%5Fyaml) was committed by Anthony Minessale II in 2008 with commit message "[Yet Another Mega Labotomy](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/commit/35dc909cf69191d51af26e26adb4d4d5bcbfcdaa)" and has remained unchanged since then.
