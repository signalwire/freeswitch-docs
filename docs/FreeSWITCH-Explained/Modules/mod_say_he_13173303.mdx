# Configuration

Start by enabling or adding the following on you _modules.conf_ file:

**modules.conf**

```xml
mod_say_he
```

If you are adding Hebrew to an existing installation, you will need to manually add the needed changes to your current configuration files. Add the following in the say section to _conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml_ in the installation directory.

**conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml**

```xml
<load module="mod_say_he">
```

Same goes for _conf/freswitch.xml_ in the installation directory. Add the following:

**conf/freswitch.xml**

```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="include" data="lang/he/*.xml"/> 
```

Compiling mod\_say\_he

If you want to manually install and compile mod\_say\_he, execute:

**Compiling mod\_say\_he**

```bash
make mod_say_he-install
/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli
reload mod_say_he
```

# Usage Example

In order to make it active you have to set the default language and the path to the recordings in your dialplan. Here is an example:

```xml
<action application="set" data="default_language=he"/>
```

And another example of pronouncing a number:

```xml
<action application="say" data="he number pronounced masculine 8744697"/>
```

The recordings were done by Daniel Barakan. For bugs and issues use [jira.freeswitch.org](http://jira.freeswitch.org)
