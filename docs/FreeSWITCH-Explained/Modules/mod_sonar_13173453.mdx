## About

NOTE: _This is just a stub page. Seven Du described this mod on the ML. I just did a C&P here to overcome the blank page effect:_

Looks like mod_sonar is just like a real Sonar that:

- You setup a remote server which can echo
- Generate some tones on the local server and call the remote server
- When the echo back use some tone_detect or VAD things to help check possible network problems

### Usage

To use this, you need two FS servers in different places, e.g.

FS1       -------------------------   FS2 (remote)

The remote server doesn't need mod\_sonar, actually it dones't need to be a FS, any server can echo back the audio should work.

Or use only one server, and deploy some loops

FS ---->------Carrier------ PSTN ---->-------- SOME WHERE ELSE --->----- PSTN ----->------ DID ---->----------
|                                                                                                            |
|(echo)--------\<-------------------------------\<------------------------------------------\<------------------|

Create an echo dialplan on FS2 (or the same FS that receive the DID side) and let it echo:

```xml
<extension name="test-sonar">
          <condition field="destination_number" expression="^echo$">
                  <action application="answer" data=""/>
                  <action application="echo" data=""/>
        </condition>
</extension>
```

then on FS1, do

```xml
originate sofia/external/echo@FS2:5080 &sonar(10)
```

It will call FS2, and send some tone streams to it, and FS2 will just echo back, and FS1 should can detect the tone echoed back and then do some statistics!

### Event

It fires a sonar::ping CUSTOM event on finish.

```xml
RECV EVENT
Event-Subclass: sonar::ping
Event-Name: CUSTOM

```

Channel Variables

It will call the remote FS, so it is a channel.

* sonar\_ping\_ref

Set a reference string so you can get it back at the sonar::ping event

* sonar\_channel\_event

Set to true to get all Channel Vars attached to sonar::ping

example:

```xml
originate {sonar_channel_event=true,sonar_ping_ref=ping_test_1}sofia/external/echo@FS2:5080 &sonar(40)
```

Maybe add ignore\_early\_media=true if you test against PSTN and the path send you early media.
