## About

`mod_managed` allows execution of Common Language Infrastructure code inside FreeSWITCH. It supports the Microsoft CLR (".NET") on Windows, as well as Mono on Windows and other platforms. Effectively, this allows use of any .NET language, such as F#, VB.NET, C#, IronRuby, IronPython, JScript.NET, and many others, to create FreeSWITCH modules, applications, and API functions.

As of July 27, 2010, `mod_managed` has a new plugin architecture. This breaks backwards compatibility -- plugins no longer subclass `ApiFunction` or `AppFunction`, but instead implement specific interfaces. With this, reloading (multiple `AppDomains`) and scripting support has been added.

## 1. Installation

`mod_managed` only supports the .NET Framework 3.5 or (as of November, 2011) Mono 2.8+. Support for older versions of Mono has been discontinued. To get `mod_managed` to build on Windows, you’ll need Visual Studio 2008 (C++ and C# to build the entire thing, although C# binaries are provided).  The precompiled Windows binaries do not include the managed part of `mod_managed`. At the moment (3-Mar-2010) you need to build the complete SLN from source to get `mod_managed`.

### 1.1 Microsoft CLR Build

`mod_managed` should "just work" with the .NET Framework 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 installed. In the build configuration manager inside Visual Studio, `mod_managed` has configurations for both Debug/Release CLR and Mono. Simply select Debug_CLR and build.

### 1.2 Mono Build

For the Mono version, the Windows build requires that Mono install be accessible at `C:\Program Files\Mono`. If you installed somewhere else, symlink it:

Windows 6+:

```bash
 mklink /d "C:\Program Files\Mono" "C:\Program Files\Mono-2.4"
```

Earlier versions:

```bash
 Get Junction: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx
 junction -d "C:\Program Files\Mono" "C:\Program Files\Mono-2.4"
```

You’ll have to generate `mono.lib` for your compiler. See details [here](http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding%5FMono) (search for `mono.def`). A batch file is provided, `monolibx86.cmd`:

```powershell
 C:\freeswitch\src\mod\languages\mod_managed>monolibx86
 C:\freeswitch\src\mod\languages\mod_managed>lib /nologo /def:mono.def /out:mono.lib /machine:x86
  Creating library mono.lib and object mono.exp
```

Make sure your PATH has the Mono bin folder in it (such as `C:\Program files\Mono\bin`) or the mod will not load.

From there, simply compile the `mod_managed` project in the languages folder. This will build the unmanaged side and the managed loader and put them in your mod directory. If you get errors, the SWIG generated interface might be out of date. From the `mod_managed` directory, you can run `runswig.cmd` to regenerate the SWIG files. This batch file assumes SWIG is accessible at `\dev\swig`.

### 1.3 Linux Build

To build on Linux, first [install Mono](http://mono-project.com/Compiling%5FMono%5FFrom%5FTarball) and make sure `languages\mod_managed` is uncommented in `modules.conf`. In the `src/mod/mod_managed` dir, you should be able to:

```xml
 make && make install
```

If this complains about pkgconfig, try:

```xml
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```

When running on Linux, you might get a `DllNotFoundException` for `libc`. Try making sure [`libc.so`](http://libc.so) is in one of the `ldconfig` paths. For example, on a clean CentOS 5.3 x64 system, I had to do this:

```xml
 ln -s /lib64/libc-2.5.so /lib64/libc.so
```

Followed by `ld` config. Almost all `DllNotFoundExceptions` are because of incorrect `ld` paths.

As of November 2011, the error with finding [`libc.so`](http://libc.so) has been resolved. You do not need to create a symlink anymore.

If you are experiencing `NullReferenceExceptions` with any plugin run through the dialplan, make sure you have included the appropriate entry in your [`dllmap`](http://mono-project.com/Config%5FDllMap) configuration:

### 1.4 Linux Mono 2.8 and greater Build

Mono 2.8+ support is now enabled by default, and older Mono versions are unsupported.

## 2. Loading Modules

To load `mod_managed` at FreeSWITCH start up you will need to add `<load module="mod_managed" />` to the `modules.conf.xml`. The best place for this line is in the languages sections.

`modules.conf.xml` is located in `<FS install dir>\conf\autoload_configs\`

`mod_managed` automatically scans the `<FreeSWITCH mod dir>\managed` for managed modules. (For example, this may be `C:\freeswitch\debug\mod\managed`.) `mod_managed` will not load if the `managed` subdirectory under the modules directory does not exist.

There are two main plugin interfaces: `IApiPlugin`, and `IAppPlugin`. Any assembly or script in the `managed` directory containing types implementing those interfaces will automatically get loaded and registered. The name registered is the full name (`Namespace.TypeName`), as well as just the `TypeName`. If there are conflicts, the last loaded type will overwrite previous ones.

`IAppPlugins` are only called on sessions, say, from the dialplan. `IApiPlugins` can be called anywhere from FreeSWITCH. `IApiPlugins` can be run normally (`managed/Execute`), as well as in the background on their own thread (`managedrun/ExecuteBackground`).

A third plugin interface, `ILoadNotificationPlugin`, is for controlling loading of scripts or assemblies. If any `ILoadNotificationPlugin` returns false from Load, the file will not be loaded. This is also a way to get notified when your code is being loaded and perform initialization tasks.

### 2.1 Dynamic Loading

`mod_managed` will watch the `managed` directory for changes to loaded files and their config files. Any changes will trigger a reload of that file. First, the file will be re-read and loaded. Then the previous version will be unloaded. The only notification provided is via the `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.DomainUnload` event.

To force a reload, use the managed reload command: `managedreloadmy.dll`.

## 3. Scripting

`mod_managed` now supports scripting via any managed language. Simply drop a script file in the `managed` directory, and `mod_managed` will compile it and load it into memory (and reload it when changed).

Scripts must produce a valid entry point. Entry points must be public for use on Mono. An entry point may return a value, and may take a single string array parameter, however, the return value is not checked, and the string array parameter will always be empty.

Inside the script, check the static variable FreeSWITCH.Script.ContextType to see how the script is being invoked: `App`, `Apior`, `ApiBackground`. Based on that, obtain the context via `Script.GetAppContext()`, `Script.GetApiContext()` or `Script.GetApiBackgroundContext()`. At that point, it is exactly like having a precompiled plugin.

In contrast to other scripting environments, `mod_managed` loads your script into memory and initializes it once. This provides a huge performance increase over loading it each time. Static variables are shared across invocations of a script,so that caching and other scenarios are enabled. Do be aware of multithreading issues, as multiple threads will be in your script at the same time.

Scripts can define types that implement the plugin interfaces. These will be loaded and registered like normal.

The built-in supported languages are [F# (`.fsx`)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/), VB (`.vbx`), C# (`.csx`) and JScript.NET (`.jsx`). Note the different extensions -- `mod_managed` will ignore `.cs`, `.vb`, and `.js` files. Mono does not seem to support `JScript.NET`. Other language support is being looked at.

Scripts can be precompiled as `.exe`s. Simply drop a `.exe` into the `managed` directory, and `mod_managed` will pick it up like any other script file. This allows deployment without source, as well as deploying scripts that `mod_managed` cannot dynamically compile.

## 4. Native Interop

`mod_managed` exposes nearly the entire FreeSWITCH C API (courtesy of SWIG). This allows creation of not just API functions and call apps, but any type of module that FreeSWITCH supports (codecs, endpoints, etc.). The types are in the FreeSWITCH.Native namespace. FreeSWITCH.Native. The FreeSWITCH.Native.freeswitch type contains static members to access all the functions.

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 DRK Presentation

DaveKompel(DRK) gave a presentation about `mod_managed` on the May 12, 2010 weekly FreeSWITCH conf call:

### 5.2 Demo.cs

See Demo.cs in `mod_managed\managed`. To specify a function, use the name of the type (such as `AppDemo` or `ApiDemo`). You can also fully qualify with the namespace and type name, ex: `FreeSWITCH.Demo.AppDemo`.

### 5.3 Parking Lot Sample

An implementation of a [FreePBX-like parking lot module](http://github.com/joshrivers/FreeSWITCH%5FManaged%5FParkingLot) demonstrates using API and APP plugins with cepstral text to speech.

## 6. Dialplan and Example

You may point to your managed application by entering the routing into the dialplan as demonstrated below.

```xml
<extension name="testapp">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(1024)">
     <action application="managed" data="yourclassname"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

## 7. AbortOnHangup

With `mod_managed` 1.0.4, this is no longer used. Email the FreeSWITCH developer list if you need this functionality.

## 8. ODBC on Linux

For some reason, `mod_managed` doesn't pickup Mono's [`dllmap`](http://mono-project.com/Config%5FDllMap) entries for odbc32.dll to [`unixodbc.so`](http://unixodbc.so). So, to get ODBC support working, you'll need to create an `odbc32.dll` link, for example:

```xml
ln -s /lib64/libodbc.so /lib64/odbc32.dll
```
