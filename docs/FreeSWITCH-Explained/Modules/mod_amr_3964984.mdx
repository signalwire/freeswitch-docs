## About

AMR incorporates patented technologies to do an _Adaptive Multi-Rate_ on the bandwidth a codec will use. Due to the patent concerns this module can only be distributed to individuals with prior licensing in place from the patent holders. Licensing is being worked on and FreeSWITCH™ may be able to offer licensing terms in the future for this module.
