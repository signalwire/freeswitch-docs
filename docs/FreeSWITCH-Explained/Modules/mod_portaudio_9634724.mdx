# mod_portaudio 

 

## About

mod\_portaudio is used for interfacing with sound card. This scenario is usually used when FreeSWITCH is used for a softphone basis, or as an easy way to get a local connection for development.

Interaction with mod\_portaudio usually happens at the Freeswitch CLI, including setup, placing calls, answering calls, etc.

Many [Softphones](../Interoperability/Softphones/index.mdx#about) use [embedded FreeSWITCH](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Embedding-FreeSWITCH/index.mdx#php) and portaudio at their core. Two examples are [FSComm](../Interoperability/Softphones/FSComm_7143564.mdx#about) a QT4 cross platform communicator and [FSClient](../Interoperability/Softphones/FSClient_7143562.mdx#about) a Windows .NET 4.0 softphone.

Portaudio (PA) is a cross-platform library.

Beware mod\_portaudio recently had a large hunk of code injected into it and the configuration related to Shared Streams. For most scenarios this is not required and my throw (generally harmless) errors. Please see the note on [#Shared\_Streams\_and\_Endpoints](http://freeswitch.org#shared%5Fsreams%5Fand%5Fendpoints) for more details.

### Command Reference

* A device\_ident is either part of the device name or the device ID number (prefixed with a #) seen in pa devlist.

#### pa help - print usage summary

Will show the available commands

#### pa devlist \[xml\] - list audio devices

The list will be in the following format: device number;short name;input channels;output channels;freeswitch device configuration

The freeswitch device configuration is a comma separated list of these elements:

r   device is ring device
i   device is input device
o   device is output device

For example:

```xml
API CALL [pa(devlist)] output:
0;AC97 Audio (PCM);2;0
1;AC97 Audio (PCM);0;2
2;AC97 Audio (SPDIF);0;2
3;Jabra BT500;1;1
```

  
#### pa indev (device_ident), pa outdev (device_ident), pa switchstream (in_device_ident) (out_device_ident) - Set input/output device streams

Set the input (indev) or output (outdev) audio stream identified by device\_ident. pa switchstream can switch both streams at once. These functions can only be use during a call if live-stream-switch configuration option is on.

#### pa ringdev (device_ident)

Set the device for portaudio to ring on a ringing call.

#### pa preparestream (in_device_ident) (out_device_ident) - Prepare an input and output device stream for use

Not required but preparing a stream prior to switching to it using the indev/outdev/switchstream allows portaudio to open the stream prior to using it. This makes for much more seamless switching between streams (no audio cut out). You only need to call this once before switching to that stream, streams are kept open until the end of all active calls. Calling it multiple times on the same stream will not cause delays or have negative effects.

#### pa call (number) \[(dialplan)\] \[(cid_name)\] \[(cid_num)\] - Place a new call

If you currently are on a call the existing call is placed on hold.

#### pa switch \[(call_id)|none\] - swap to a new active call

If used without args will switch to the previously active call. If a call\_id (from pa list) is past will make that call active. If none is past then all calls are placed on hold.

#### pa list - view the current calls

pa list

#### pa dtmf (dtmf_digits) - send a dtmf string (1234) to the current call

pa dtmf 1234

#### pa answer \[(call_id)\] - Answer a ringing call

Without a call\_id will answer the oldest call, with the call ID will answer that specific call

#### pa hangup \[(call_id)\] - End a call

Will end the current call if no ID is given otherwise will end the call with that ID.

#### pa rescan - Look for new devices

Portaudio assumes devices will not change during use, if they do you will need to use rescan for portaudio to see them. As this causes portaudio to re-init several things it cannot be used during an active call.

#### pa play \[ringtest|(filename)\] \[(seconds)\] \[no_close\] - Play an audio file or test stream to a device

Allows playing of arbitrary audio on the outdev device, optionally for only a specific number of seconds. no\_close causes the audio stream to remain open after playing (allows for faster concurrent playing)

#### pa playdev (device_ident) \[ringtest|(filename)\] \[(seconds)\] \[no_close\] - Play an audio file or test stream to a specific device

Same as play but takes the device to play to also

#### pa flags on|off \[ear\] \[mouth\] - Set mute or deaf

Mutes the indev so no audio is directed to an active call, or deaf will silence the outdev from playing and audio

#### pa closestreams - Will close all active open streams

By default all streams are only closed at the end of all active calls, you can force them to close using pa closestreams as long as there is not an active call.

#### pa dump - Debug dump of all the devices

Dumps a variety of information about the various audio devices PA sees

### Sample Implementations

#### Sample Softphone Configuration

For a sample Softphone configuration, see: [Freeswitch\_Softphone](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Embedding-FreeSWITCH/FreeSWITCH-Softphone_7143559.mdx#about)

#### Sample Mumble \<-> Conference Bridge

Available with full instructions for Linux-based configurations at: [Mumble\_conference\_with\_alsa](../Auxiliary-Knowledge-and-Utilities/Mumble-Conference-With-ALSA_13173534.mdx#about)

#### Sample mod_portaudio intercom (auto answer)

In your dialplan, you can easily setup a portaudio intercom to dial into.

```xml
<extension name="Beaker portaudio intercom <pain>">
	<condition field="destination_number" expression="^7246$">
		<action application="bridge" data="portaudio/auto_answer"/>
	</condition>
</extension>
```

Note, to easily remember the extension number, we use the T9 translate of the acronym "PortAudio INtercom" aka PAIN, which is 7246\. Go ahead and dial 7246 and you will immediately be able to talk over the portaudio speaker :-)

Note too, in real life you should probably have some kind of notifying tone so nobody can silently eavesdrop on you.

#### PA System w/ Chime

A modification to the Intercom sample can be used to feed to a Public Address system. Chime plays before and after paging.

```xml
<extension name="paging-with-chime">
	<condition field="destination_number" expression="^7243$">
		<action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app=playback"/>
		<action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_data=/tmp/2_tone_chime.wav"/>
		<action application="set" data="api_after_bridge=luarun post-chime.lua"/>
		<action application="bridge" data="portaudio/auto_answer"/>
	</condition>
</extension>
```

**post-chime.lua:**

```xml
   api = freesswitch.API();
   api:execute("pa", "play /tmp/2_tone_chime.wav");
```

### Web GUI

mod\_xml\_rpc loaded portaudio supplies it's own little GUI [http://your.box:8080/api/pa](http://your.box:8080/api/pa)

### Install Notes

#### RHEL/CentOS

When building from source, make sure the "alsa-lib-devel" package is installed or you may get build errors.

#### Windows

Portaudio for windows by default builds with DirectX used for audio. It seems to provide the best results but it is possible to use the two other audio modes if desired by changing the build options.

#### macOS

There is a Homebrew formula for portaudio.

#### FreeBSD

Tested on FreeBSD-8.1 AMD64 on hardware which meets the 'Intel HD Audio' spec. Add to the FreeBSD kernel config file:

device snd\_hda device sound. Build and install the new kernel, no additional audio config is required. The configuration in portaudio.conf.xml has indev, outdev and ringdev value="0" Also requires: \<param name="dual-streams" value="true"/>

\-kimc

### Reference

#### portaudio.conf settings

These options are set in the \<settings> block of the config.

##### no-ring-during-call

Prevent an incoming call from ringing the ring device if you are already on a call

##### no-auto-resume-call

Do not auto resume the last call when the current call ends

##### live-stream-switch

Allows using the indev,outdev, and switchstream commands during a call

##### indev, outdev, ringdev

Allows you to preset the specific input and output devices you want portaudio using you can use the same device\_ident values as used in the command reference

##### debug

Set the debug level for portaudio

##### dialplan

Set the default dialplan for making calls

##### context

Set the default context for calls

##### dual-streams

The default value is _false_ which means one thread is handling the audio reading/writing from/to the core. Value _true_ means 2 threads are used instead of one.

#### Shared Streams and Endpoints

Shared streams and endpoints are completely different than everything else mentioned on this page and are not required for most cases of using portaudio (especially if you are just using FS as a single softphone). They are specifically meant for if you need to use multiple audio devices on different calls at the same time. All of the stream commands above are NOT related to shared streams (just confusing terminology). The only documentation on them is found in the configuration file itself and the code was not tested by a large number of people so stability is not guaranteed. Most of the code paths for shared streams/endpoints are completely different from the rest of portaudio so most of the normal portaudio commands do not work with the shared stream/endpoint system. The commands that related to shared streams are the pa shtreams and pa endpoints commands, not the other stream commands. While you may see errors about shared streams in the console if you do not remove the configuration (per the portaudio.conf note below) these will not stop portaudio from working normally.

##### portaudio.conf \<streams> and \<endpoints>

See the note on shared streams and endpoints above. You can safely remove the \<streams> and \<endpoints> configuration sections from portaudio.conf if you do not need them, otherwise they will throw some console errors by default (that can be ignored).

#### Custom Events

Portaudio emits several custom events for major changes in portaudio. Every event will contain the pa\_call\_id variable to indicate which call is being changed.

##### portaudio::ringing

Is emitted when incoming call is received and portaudio plays the ring on the audio device.
