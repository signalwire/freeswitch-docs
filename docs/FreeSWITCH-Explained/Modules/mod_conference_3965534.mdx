## About

mod\_conference provides both inbound and outbound conference bridge service for FreeSWITCHâ„¢. It can process multiple bit rates, load various profiles that specify DTMF controls, play prompt sounds and tones, and many other functions. You can create as many conferences as you like, as long as there still are free system resources (i.e. memory, CPU power, network bandwidth) available.

Conferences created in the dialplan use profiles that are defined in conf/autoload\_configs/conference.conf.xml, if you are using the standard configuration files.

  
## Conference Configuration

Conference configuration settings are stored in `conf/autoload_configs/conference.conf.xml`

Community member [Stanislav Sinyagin](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/~ssinyagin) has posted a nice [personal blog entry](http://txlab.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/setting-up-a-conference-bridge-with-freeswitch/) on how he configured his conference bridge.

The configuration has the following structure, each "`[... config here ...]`" should be replaced with specific configuration statements as detailed in the sections that follow.

**conference.conf.xml**

```xml
<configuration name="conference.conf" description="Standard Conference configuration">

  <advertise>
    	[... config here ...]
  </advertise>

  <caller-controls>
    <group name="default">
    	[... config here ...]
    </group>
  </caller-controls>

  <chat-permissions>
    <profile name="default">
    	[... config here ...]
    </profile>
  </chat-permissions>    

  <profiles>
    <profile name="default">
    	[... config here ...]
    </profile>
  </profiles>


</configuration>
```

  
### advertise  

This block specifies whether empty conferences should be advertised in presence, allowing you to see status of empty conferences. Any endpoint that supports presence, such as mod\_sofia, can subscribe to these presence notifications.

  
**Example configuration**

```xml
  <advertise>
    <room name="888@$${subdomain}" status="FreeSWITCH"/>
  </advertise>
```

The conference name (888 in this case) should be the profile name that you specified in \<profiles> section, $$\{subdomain} will be replaced with the subdomain that you specified in freeswitch.xml.

"status" is advertised as whatever you pass to it (identifier) or "Available" if none is passed.

#### Example 'advertise' Event via mod_event_multicast

### caller-controls

Caller controls are used to modify the state of the conference, such as lowering the volume, mute a participant, and such. Below are the commands that can be assigned to digits and executed during a conference. The "moderator-controls" group provides additional controls for participants who enter the conference with the moderator flag set. See below.

#### Reserved Control Group Names

| Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| none    | Use this name to prevent installing caller-controls for callers to a conference.                                                                                                                                                        |
| default | This group of settings will be assigned if no "caller-controls" is specified. You can also assign it explicitly. This group is defined in vanilla config, thus removing it from the configurations will make no caller controls at all. |

#### Actions

Each of these actions can be configured in caller-controls to be invoked by a conference member who enters the conference with this caller-controls group. These are instances of the conference API.

| Action               | Description                                                                                                                           | Min. Version |

    <group name="somekeys">
      <control action="vol talk dn"         digits="1"/>
      <control action="vol talk zero"       digits="2"/>
      <control action="vol talk up"         digits="3"/>
      <control action="transfer"            digits="5"   data="100 XML default"/>
      <control action="execute_application" digits="0"   data="playback conf_help.wav"/>
      <control action="execute_application" digits="#"   data="execute_dialplan conference-menu"/>
    </group>
  </caller-controls>
```

Limitations

Be aware that the caller-controls are applied across the entire conference session. You cannot apply one group of caller-controls to one member and then a second group of caller-controls to a second member in the same conference session.

  
### chat-permissions

The FreeSWITCH conference also provides limited chat capabilities via SIP, XMPP, and [Verto](./mod_verto_3964934.mdx#about).

A conference can be controlled through chat. This profile exists as part of the conference entity so you can have multiple profiles to limit access. When the conference [advertises](#conference-configuration) its presence (above) to a chat server, anyone on a federated server can talk to it and issue commands by typing messages via their favorite chat client (even if that is another FreeSWITCHâ„¢ box). To send commands to ConferenceA, from your jabber client send a message to conf+ConferenceA@freeswitch.mydomain.com

As of revision 3789 all commands except "list" have been disabled "until there is security"

  
Another Note: After spending much time trying to get control of mod\_conference via Openfire XMPP server, asked around, and "bougyman" suggested that XMPP muc functionality is very limited as of January 2012.

Here is an example configuration

**chat-permissions example**

```xml
 <configuration name="conference.conf" description="Audio Conference">
  <profiles>
   <profile name="default">
    <param name="chat-permissions" value="default"/>
   </profile>
  </profiles>
  <chat-permissions>
   <profile name="default">
    <!-- both of these users have a functionally equivalent capability set -->
    <user name="bob@somewhere.com" commands="all"/>
    <!-- individually specified commands must be enclosed with the | (pipe) character -->
    <user name="harry@elsewhere.com" commands="|deaf|dial|energy|kick|list|lock|mute|norecord|play|record|relate|say|saymember|stop|transfer|undeaf|unlock|unmute|volume_in|volume_out|"/>
   </profile>
  </chat-permissions>
 </configuration>
```

### profiles

You can specify a number of different profiles in the profiles section, these will let you easily apply a number of settings to a conference. Please note that the profiles are not conference rooms, but define settings that are later applied to conference rooms. The dialplan section in this document will describe how you create conference rooms and apply these profile settings.

**profiles structure**

```xml
  <profiles>
    <profile name="default">
      <param name="paramName" value="paramValue"/>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
```

You can have any number of \<profile> tags, and each \<profile> can have any number of \<param> tags up to the entire set of parameters.

#### Conference Profile Parameters

You may specify the conference profile parameters listed below. Keep in mind that if TTS is enabled all audio-file params beginning with 'say:' will be considered text to say with TTS. A TTS module must be loaded by FreeSWITCH for this to work.

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Example value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Allowed value                                        | Default value            | Played for | Min.

| energy-level                        | Noise gate. Energy level required for audio to be sent to the other users. The energy level is a minimum threshold of 'voice energy' that must be present before audio is bridged into the conference. Useful if a participant is in a noisy environment, so their background noise is heard only when they speak. 0 disables the noise gate and will bridge all packets even if they are only background noise.                                           | 300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 0-1800                                               |                          |            |              |
| interval                            | Number of milliseconds per frame. Which may be different from ptime in SIP SDP, or driver with TDM. Higher numbers require less CPU but can degrade conversation quality, so experimentation with your setup is best. The default is good for conversation quality. Special "auto" value sets interval based on interval of the first member who enters.                                                                                                   | 20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 10-120 (only if divisible by 10) or auto             |                          |            |              |

## Conference Dialplan Application

The conference dialplan application is used to create conferences and to bind a profile to them.

**Syntax**

```xml
<action application="conference" data="confname[@profile][+[pin][+flags{mute|deaf|...}]">
<action application="conference" data="bridge:confname[@profile]:none|endpoint[+flags{mute|deaf|...}]">
```

The first time a conference name (confname) is used, it will be created on demand, and the pin will be set to what ever is specified at that time: the pin in the data string if specified, or if not, the "pin" setting in the conference profile, and if that is also unspecified, then there is no pin protection. Any later attempt to join the conference must specify the same pin number, if one existed when it was created.

"profile" should be one of those specified in the conference configuration, or "default".

If the data value starts with "`bridge:`" then it is a bridging conference. The conference name should not be already in use. You can specify the special literal value of "\_uuid\_" for the conference name, and a a session-specific unique id will be generated for you.

Conferences stay alive until the number of members falls below the minimum. The minimum for bridging conferences is 2, and for other dynamically created conferences is 1.

| bridge:\_uuid\_:none                                                          | a "bridging" conference with UUID assigned as conference name          |
| \*Note that while some parameters are optional, their order is very important |                                                                        |

**Simple Dialplan Example**

```xml
<action application="conference" data="meeting@mykeys">
```

**Bridging conference example that plays ringback while other party is bridged in**

```xml
<extension name="test_bridging_conference">
   <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(3000)$">
      <action application="answer"/>
      <action application="playback" data="connecting_your_call.wav"/>
      <action application="set" data="ringback=${us-ring}"/>
      <action application="conference" data="bridge:$1-${domain_name}@default:user/1000@${domain_name}"/>
   </condition>
</extension>
```

#### Adding Callers From Within The Conference With DTMF 

By combining several elements â€” the dialplan, API calls, bind\_digit\_action â€” you can create a simple system for a caller to add another user to the conference. See [Conference\_Add\_Call\_Example](../Conference/Conference-Add-Call-Example_5046337.mdx#about) for the code and explanation.

#### Announcing Caller Count While In Conference 

See [Conference Announce Count Inline](../Conference/Conference-Announce-Count-Inline_5046354.mdx#about) for a simple example of how to allow a caller to hear an announcement of how many members are in the conference.

####  Propagate Out-of-Band DTMF to Conference Members 

By default, out-of-band DTMF signals ([RFC 2833](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2833)?) are absorbed by the conference. However, there are two ways to accomplish this:

* Set the dist-dtmf member flag in the conference configuration XML, eg: \<param name="member-flags" value="dist-dtmf"/> With this parameter set, all of the caller controls such as modifying volume will be disabled and DTMF will simply pass through to all other members of the conference.
* There is also an API call that will allow your application to send DTMF to a single conference member or all members:

    \<confname> dtmf-string \<[member_id|all|last]> \<digits>

#### Prompt for Name  

 Dialplan to prompt callers to speak their names before joining the conference and announce their name to other participants.

**Speak name**

```xml
  <extension name="Record Name and schedule conf announce">

#### API Additional Notes

##### dial and bgdial

If the caller id values are not set, the variables in conference.conf.xml will be used. Specifically, the value for caller-id-number will be used for the number and the value for caller-id-name will be used for the name.

If the conference will be dynamically created as a result of this api call (ie this will be the first participant in the conference) - and the caller id name and number is not provided in the api call - the number and name will be "00000000" and "FreeSWITCH". This appears to be unaffected by the variables in conference.conf.xml.

<action application="set" data="conf_sounddir=${conference(${conference_name} get sound_prefix)}"/>
<action application="set" data="conf_oldsound=${conference(${conference_name} set sound_prefix ${sound_prefix_pl})}"/>
<action application="set" data="void_result=${conference(${conference_name} set endconference_grace_time 300)}"/>
```

##### list

###### Command Output

First line:

* Conference \<conference name> (\<member\_count> member\[s\]\[ locked\])  
   * â€œlocked" - The lock/unlock status of the conference.

Each following line is a comma-separated list for each conference leg with the following items:

* id of participant(starts at 1 after FS restart)
* Register string of participant
* UUID of participant's call leg
* Caller id name
* Caller id number
* Status (hear|speak|talking|video|floor)  
   * â€œhear" - The mute/unmute status of the member.  
   * â€œspeak" - The â€œdeaf /undeaf" status of the member.  
   * â€œtalking" - The input channel is currently providing some amount of sound energy into conference.  
   * â€œvideo" - Providing video?  
   * â€œfloor" - This member currently owns the floor.
* Volume In setting
* Detected energy
* Volume Out setting
* Energy Level setting

  
**A handy way to test in an XML dialplan if a conference is active and allow a late caller to join**

```xml
<extension name="late entry">
   <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(300\d)$" />
   <condition field="${conference $1 list count}" expression="^\d+">
      <action application="conference" data="$1@default++flags{nomoh}"/>
   </condition>
</extension>
```

If the conference is not active, the second "condition" test will fail and bypass this dialplan extension entry. If the conference is active the caller will join it with the 'nomoh' flag set.

#### relate

conference \<conf-name> relate \<datum-member1>[,\<datum-member2>] \<related-member1>[,\<related-member2>] \<relationship>

\<datum> is the conference member that is the subject of the relation; in other words, the relationship will be established with respect to \<datum>

\<related-member> is the conference member that will be affected by the relate command

\<relationship> can be one of

* nohear â€” the datum member will no longer hear the related-member; i.e. datum's ear will be muted to related-member's mouth
* nospeak â€” the datum member will no longer be able to speak to the related-member
* clear â€” reset the relationship between the two conference members

Note that "relate 1 2 nohear" gives the same result as "relate 2 1 nospeak", it is simply a matter of perspective.

##### Examples

conference 3000 relate 1 2 nospeak

Member 1 may now no longer speak to member 2, i.e. member 2 now cannot hear member 1.

conference 3000 relate 1 2 clear

Member 1 may now speak to member 2 again

  
conference 3100 relate 1 2 nohear

Member 1 now cannot hear member 2

conference 3100 relate 1 2 clear

Member 1 can now hear member 2 again

  
Both conference-member arguments can take multiple values, separated by commas (but no spaces!)

conference 3300 relate 1,2 3 nospeak

Member 1 and member 2 may now no longer speak to member 3.

conference 3001 relate 1 2,3 nohear

Member 1 now cannot hear member 2 nor member 3

  
## Event Socket Use

You can subscribe to the following to receive conference events:

 conference::maintenance

The "suppress-events" parameter can be added to the conference profile to prevent events from firing. e.g. if you're not interested in start or stop talking events:

  \<profile name="default">
    ...other options...
    \<param name="suppress-events" value="start-talking,stop-talking"/>
  \</profile>

The events that can be suppressed are:

del-member, energy-level, volume-level, gain-level, dtmf, stop-talking, start-talking, mute-member, unmute-member, kick-member, dtmf-member, energy-level-member, volume-in-member, volume-out-member, play-file, play-file-member, speak-text, speak-text-member, lock, unlock, transfer, bgdial-result and floor-change.

## Outbound Conference

Use **conference\_set\_auto\_outcall** to have **mod\_conference** call endpoints and join them to a conference bridge. To have it call more than one participant, just repeat the **conference\_set\_auto\_outcall** action in the dialplan for each destination number or address.

**Syntax**

```xml
<action application="conference_set_auto_outcall" data="dialstring"/>
```

#### Example

Here is an example of using **conference\_set\_auto\_outcall** with some of the other conference\_auto\_outcall\_\* parameters to start a conference when someone dials **12345**. Extensions 1000 and 1001 will be dialed when the conference starts and will enter the conference muted.

**Outbound example**

```xml
<extension name="Demonstrate conference_set_auto_outcall">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(12345)$">
    
    <action application="answer"/>
    
    <action application="set" data="conference_auto_outcall_timeout=5"/>
    <action application="set" data="conference_utils_auto_outcall_flags=mute"/>
    <action application="set" data="conference_auto_outcall_caller_id_name=$${effective_caller_id_name}"/>

```

Note that the internal extensions 1000 and 1001 will provide no ringback to avoid polluting the conference bridge with excessive noise, but the gateway is not under control of FreeSWITCH so it will provide early media.

Alternatively, you can set multiple destinations in one line, just remember to escape your variables if you have more than one or any non-escaped chars in it.

```xml
<action application="conference_set_auto_outcall" data="['var1=a,var2=b']user/1001@$${domain},['var1=c,var2=d']user/1002@$${domain}"/>

| conference\_enforce\_security         | Allows the conference security to be overridden. This applies in two different scenarios, one for inbound and one for outbound.By default, conference security is always applied to inbound calls and is always skipped for outbound calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Inbound\<action application="set" data="conference\_enforce\_security=false"/> \<action application="conference" data="3000"/> Outboundoriginate \{conference\_enforce\_security=true}sofia/internal/1001 &conference(3000)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |              |            |            |            |           |           |                           |           |                    |                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |

| conference\_output\_discard\_low\_energy             | If the packet's energy level is less than this value and there are more than 2 packets waiting in the output buffer (audio from the conference to this member) then drop this packet. A few low energy packets must be sent first before any are dropped to avoid totally truncating silence. To discard the standard comfort noise in a conference, set this to 15 or higher. Default is 0 (don't discard low energy packets).                                                                                   | \<action application="set" data="conference\_output\_discard\_low\_energy=20"/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 20.23.2 |            |            |            |           |           |                           |           |                    |                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |
| conference\_permanent\_wait\_mod\_moh | This variable controls how the enter and exit sounds interact with the MOH when the wait\_mod flag is set. When this variable is set to true, the MOH keeps playing andthe enter and exit sounds are mixed with the MOH.

## Conference Variables

Conference level variables can be set on the profile, in the variables section of the profile.

**Conference Variables Example**

```xml
  <profiles>
    <profile name="default">
	<variables>                                                                                                                                             
		<variable name="mycustomvar" value="customvalue">
	</variables>
  </profiles>

```

Since version 1.10.8 variables can also be set using the conference "getvar" and "setvar" api commands. and also any channel variables prefixed with "confvar\_" will be converted into conference variables.

## Sound files

Just about any format is supported, but currently it must be at the sample rate of the conference (no resampling is done). Since disk is cheaper than CPU, use a wav.

## Custom Conference Layouts

Layout grid is square, its directly proportional to the canvas resolution and aspect ratio. These layouts will work on 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. The values x, y, and scale are all of a range of 0-360, proportional to the actual final resolution.
