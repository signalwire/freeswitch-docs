## About

Logs all inbound registration attempts, and failed registrations to a log file "/usr/local/freeswitch/log/fail2ban.log" _(configurable)_ The advantage to using this module for fail2ban rather than the standard FS log is that you don't have to keep your server log level as verbose.

Hello everyone, I've written a FreeSWITCH module for the application Fail2ban.
It currently logs all inbound registration attempts, and failed registrations 
to a log file "/usr/local/freeswitch/log/fail2ban.log" _(configurable)_
The advantage to using this module for fail2ban rather than the standard FS log
is that you don't have to keep your server log level as verbose.

## Install instructions

* Source: [https://github.com/kyconquers/freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban](https://github.com/kyconquers/freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban)
* `git clone [https://github.com/kyconquers/freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban.git](https://github.com/kyconquers/freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban.git)`
* Put the config file in autoload\_configs and adjust as necessary.
* Enter the directory and do `make && make install`
* To load manually: in fs\_cli, `load mod_fail2ban`
* To load automatically: in modules.conf.xml, add `mod_fail2ban`

## Hint

If make fails with sth. like this:

* `` make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/local/src/freeswitch-mod_fail2ban/freeswitch-mod_fail2ban.c', needed by `[freeswitch-mod_fail2ban.la](http://freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban.la)'.  `` `Stop`

clone the git into your freeswitch source directory, i.e. /usr/local/src/freeswitch/src/mod/applications/mod\_fail2ban and execute make from there:

* cd /usr/local/src/freeswitch/src/mod/applications
* git clone [https://github.com/kyconquers/freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban.git](https://github.com/kyconquers/freeswitch-mod%5Ffail2ban.git) mod\_fail2ban
* make && make install
