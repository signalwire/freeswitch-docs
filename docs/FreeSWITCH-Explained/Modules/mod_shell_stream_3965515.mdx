## About

Mod shell stream is a module to allow you to stream audio from an arbitrary shell command. You could use it to read audio from a database, from a soundcard, etc.

## Usage

To use it, you call it from the dialplan like this:

```xml
<action application="playback" data="shell_stream:///tmp/moh"/>
```

Now, when this application is triggered, the command /tmp/moh is called with 2 arguments -r \<rate> and -c \<channelcount>, which in the usual case are 8000 and 1 respectively.

The contents of my sample /tmp/moh script is as follows:

```xml
#!/bin/sh

cat /tmp/tt-weasels.wav | sox -t wav - $@ -t raw -
```

Which cats an audio file into sox on stdin and tells sox to output raw audio at 8000hz, 1 channel to stdout. You could of course replace the cat command with anything that outputs audio and use sox to process it into the requested raw output.

### Arguments

You can also pass arguments to the command, by doing something like this:

```xml
<action application="playback" data="shell_stream:///tmp/moh /tmp/tt-weasels.wav wav"/>
```

And the corresponding script becomes:

```xml
#!/bin/sh

AUDIO=$1
TYPE=$2
shift 2
cat $AUDIO | sox -t $TYPE - $@ -t raw -
```

Basically the sky is the limit, if you're willing to write the script or program to do what you need.
