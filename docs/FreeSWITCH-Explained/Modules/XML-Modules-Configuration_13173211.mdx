# XML Modules Configuration 

 

TODO This should be incorporated with [Modules](index.mdx#about). Also, I don't think there is a main description on how to enable a module; all the steps are either with a specific module or non-existent.That is, there is a general part (uncomment or put line in `modules.conf.xml` , restart freeswitch (or just `reloadxml` ?), etc), and specific part (e.g., with [mod\_erlang\_event](mod_erlang_event_1048926.mdx#api), Erlang has to be pre-installed with its developer headers, etc).

## XML Modules Configuration

modules.conf.xml is a configuration entity that exists in the "configuration" section of [freeswitch.xml](../Introduction/Understanding-the-Configuration-Files.mdx#xml). It denotes which modules to load, and in what order.

In order for a module to be loaded, it needs to have been compiled and installed to the proper location on the system. If you do not know how to compile/install a specific module, please read the [Installation Guide](../Installation/index.mdx#about).

Modules are only loaded if the above conditions are met. Simply including a module's configuration in freeswitch.xml will not cause a module to load.

As an example:

* We want to load syslog to be get logging if something fails during production.
* We'll load mod\_cdr to get call data records out of the system (nice for billing).
* We'll use mod\_event\_socket to be able to get events for all connected user agents (and later on controlling them)
* We'll use the xml dialplan for simplicity.
* Finally we load spidermonkey to be able to write javascript ivr applications and mod\_cepstral to get TTS.

The rest of the modules are pretty standard and should not be removed
