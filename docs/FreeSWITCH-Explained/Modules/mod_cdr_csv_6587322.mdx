## 0\. About

This module allows you to log call detail records (CDRs) to a text file using text generation templates. These templates along with the default configuration are stored in the file `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/cdr_csv.conf.xml`.

Which template is used for the default is defined by the line below (which uses "example" in the default installation).

```xml
<param name="default-template" value="example"/>
```

 Further down in the `cdr_csv.conf.xml` file, the "example" template is defined within the `<templates>`, `</templates>` opening and closing tags. Therefore to change what is being logged you may edit the example template or create a new template and update the `default-template` param to that template name.

## 1\. Default configuration

**\<conf\_dir>/autoload\_configs/cdr\_csv.conf.xml**

```xml
<configuration name="cdr_csv.conf" description="CDR CSV Format">
<settings>
  <!-- 'cdr-csv' will always be appended to log-base -->
  <!--<param name="log-base" value="/var/log"/>-->
  <param name="default-template" value="example"/>
  <!-- This is like the info app but after the call is hung up -->
  <!--<param name="debug" value="true"/>-->
  <param name="rotate-on-hup" value="true"/>
  <!-- may be a b or ab -->
  <param name="legs" value="a"/>
</settings>
<templates>
  <template name="sql">INSERT INTO cdr VALUES ("${caller_id_name}","${caller_id_number}","${destination_number}","${context}","${start_stamp}","${answer_stamp}","${end_stamp}","${duration}","${billsec}","${hangup_cause}","${uuid}","${bleg_uuid}", "${accountcode}");</template>
  <template name="example">"${caller_id_name}","${caller_id_number}","${destination_number}","${context}","${start_stamp}","${answer_stamp}","${end_stamp}","${duration}","${billsec}","${hangup_cause}","${uuid}","${bleg_uuid}","${accountcode}","${read_codec}","${write_codec}"</template>
  <template name="snom">"${caller_id_name}","${caller_id_number}","${destination_number}","${context}","${start_stamp}","${answer_stamp}","${end_stamp}","${duration}","${billsec}","${hangup_cause}","${uuid}","${bleg_uuid}", "${accountcode}","${read_codec}","${write_codec}","${sip_user_agent}","${call_clientcode}","${sip_rtp_rxstat}","${sip_rtp_txstat}","${sofia_record_file}"</template>

  <template name="asterisk">"${accountcode}","${caller_id_number}","${destination_number}","${context}","${caller_id}","${channel_name}","${bridge_channel}","${last_app}","${last_arg}","${start_stamp}","${answer_stamp}","${end_stamp}","${duration}","${billsec}","${hangup_cause}","${amaflags}","${uuid}","${userfield}"</template>
</templates>
</configuration>
```

Useful things to know: 

* You can change the `legs` value `a` for a-leg, `b` for b-leg and `ab` for both legs.
* The template can be changed to include useful information such as `${remote_media_ip}` and `${network_addr}`
* The template can be changed to include any custom variables you have set in the dialplan of the corresponding leg, with something like `{customer_name=whitehouse}sofia/gateway/foo/$1`. Then `${customer_name}` can be used in the CDR template.
* If you log CDR for only one leg and you would like to include some data of the other leg, then u need to prefix `aleg_` or `bleg_` before the variable in the template
* If you log b-leg then variables can be used directly for that leg such as `${caller_id_name}` and the a-leg variables need to be prefixed with `aleg_` and `bleg_` if you log a-leg calls

## 2\. API commands

To rotate CDRs without HUPing (i.e., shutting down) the entire FreeSWITCH instance (if `rotate-on-hup` is set, that is, see below).

**In fs\_cli**

```xml
cdr_csv rotate
```

Or, from the system terminal:

**On the system terminal**

```xml
fs_cli -x 'cdr_csv rotate'
```

## 2\. XML

### 2.1 Settings (`<settings>`)

The following parameters (self-closing `<param>` tags in `<settings>`) can be set under the `<settings>` tag in your `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/cdr_csv.conf.xml` file.

```xml
<settings>
  <param name="PARAM-NAME-HERE" value="VALUE"/>
  <!-- PARAM-NAME-HERE = debug, default-template, legs, etc. -->

  <!-- param 2 -->
  <!-- ...     -->
  <!-- param N -->
</settings>
```

#### `debug`

When set to true, this prints out all channel data in your log when creating a new CDR record is generated.

* Possible values: `true`, `false`
* Default value: `false`

#### `default-template`

The name of a template as defined in the `<templates>` section of your `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/cdr_csv.conf.xml`.

* Default value: `default`

#### `legs`

Choose whether the module will save CDRs for the a or b leg, or both of them.

* Possible values: `a`, `b`, `ab`
* Default value: `a`

#### `log-base`

The directory where the CSV files will be written to.

* Default value: \<`root-of-your-freeswitch-installation>/log/cdr-csv` (or `/var/log/freeswitch/`)
* The value can be overridden by `cdr_csv_base` channel variable.

#### `master-file-only`

When enabled, all CDRs will be written to a single file instead of to multiple files split up per `accountcode`.

* Possible values: `true`, `false`
* Default value: `false`

#### `rotate-on-hup`

When enabled, after sending a HUP signal to FreeSWITCH (i.e., when the FreeSWITCH server is stopped), the logfile will be rotated to a format like this:

`Master.csv.YYYY-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS`

* Possible values: `true`, `false`
* Default value: TODO What is the default?

## 3\. FreeSWITCH variables in a template (`<template>`)

FreeSWITCH variables are given in the form `${varname}`. For an overview of variables, check [Channel Variables](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Channel%5FVariables "Channel Variables"). You can specify any channel variable.

API calls can also be specified in variables, such as:

```xml
<template name="custom_timestamp">"${expr(${end_epoch}-${my_timestamp})}"</template>
```

For example, the first line below shows the definition of the default `example` template, and the second one is the output after a successful call:

```xml
<template name="example">
"${caller_id_name}","${caller_id_number}","${destination_number}",
"${context}",       "${start_stamp}",     "${answer_stamp}",
"${end_stamp}",     "${duration}",        "${billsec}",
"${hangup_cause}",  "${uuid}",            "${bleg_uuid}",
"${accountcode}",   "${read_codec}",      "${write_codec}"
</template>


"+19168897510",        "+19168897510",                         "+19167324000",
"default",             "2020-10-12 16:52:37",                  "2020-10-12 16:52:37",
"2020-10-12 16:52:42", "5",                                    "5",
"NORMAL_CLEARING",     "5f26b500-d6b1-4c8a-b3ed-cfbea629f011", "",
"",                    "PCMU",                                 "PCMU"

```

### 3.1 Some notable FreeSWITCH variables

Read about [Variables](../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about), and see the full list in [Channel Variables](../Dialplan/Channel-Variables_16352493.mdx#about).

#### `accountcode`

An arbitrary value given at whim. Useful for billing and segregating calls by account. This is the `accountcode` of the aleg.

If the value of the [accountcode variable](../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about) matches the name of a template then that template will be used. This is valuable for having a specific template be used on a per-call basis.

#### `amaflags`

Automatic Message Accounting, an archaic system that "flags" CDR for post-processing. Commonly used flags are `billing`, `default`, `documentation`, `omit`.

#### `answer_epoch`

UNIX [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix%5Fepoch) value when the call was answered, eg. 1294060468 for Mon, 03 Jan 2011 13:14:28 GMT.

#### `answer_stamp`

Timestamp when the call was answered (eg, SIP 200 OK is received), in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), in the local timezone (not UTC). If the call is not answered, this will be an empty string.

#### `billsec`

The answered or billing span of the calls in seconds, i.e. "end\_stamp - answer\_stamp". Should only be > 0 in calls where HANGUP\_CAUSE == NORMAL\_CLEARING (16).

#### `bleg_uuid`

The [UUID](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fcdr%5Fcsv#uuid) of the bleg, i.e. the called party or terminating end.

#### `bleg_uuidaccountcode`

The `accountcode` of the `bleg_uuid` in the call.

#### `bridge_channel`

The channel name of the bleg that the aleg was bridged to. e.g. `sofia/out/+919814440333@222.199.89.27`

#### `channel_name`

This is the `channel_name` of the A-leg originating end. In this case its `sofia/in/2185738219@89.212.283.238:5060`

#### `context`

The context where the call first entered the dialplan, in this case `default.`

#### `destination_number`

This is the number (rather, extension) specified by the A-leg. The dialplan can perform any mutation on this number before its actually dialed out (in the case above a + is added).

#### `duration`

The entire duration of the call, end to end in seconds, i.e. "start\_stamp - end\_stamp". Duration should always be >= billsec.

#### `end_epoch`

UNIX [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix%5Fepoch) value when the call ended, eg. 1294060468 for Mon, 03 Jan 2011 13:14:28 GMT.

#### `end_stamp`

Timestamp when the call was hung up, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), in the local timezone (not UTC).

#### `hangup_cause`

See [Hangup Causes](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Hangup%5FCauses "Hangup Causes")

#### `last_app`

The last application run by the call; for example, `bridge` .

#### `last_arg`

The arguments passed to the last\_app, i.e. _sofia/out/+919814440203@222.199.89.27_

#### `sip_gateway_name`

See [How does FreeSWITCH CDR determine which gateway was used in failover?](http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2010-April/057411.html)

#### `start_epoch`

UNIX [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix%5Fepoch) value when the call was started, eg. 1294060468 for Mon, 03 Jan 2011 13:14:28 GMT.

#### `start_stamp`

Timestamp when the call was started, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), in the local timezone (not UTC).

#### `userfield`

A field to set your own custom values. For example:

```xml
<action application="set" data="userfield=${network_addr}"/>
```

#### `uuid`

A unique identifier for the call. A UUID is a block of 16 bytes [ref](http://docs.freeswitch.org/structswitch%5F%5Fuuid%5F%5Ft.html). This is the UUID of the aleg of the call, i.e. the calling party or origination end. According to [ref](http://docs.freeswitch.org/group%5F%5Fswitch%5F%5F%5Fu%5Fu%5Fi%5Fd.html#ga3) UUIDs are formatted as: `00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF`

## 4\. Generating SQL from template 

Some strings may contain characters that need escaping to generate a valid SQL statement. These include characters such as ', " and many non-printable characters. The API call `sql_escape` can be used to escape these variables to generate valid SQL.

For example:

```xml
<template name="sql">INSERT INTO cdr (caller_id, ...) VALUES ('${sql_escape(${caller_id_name})}', ...);</template>
```

## 5\. Examples

### 5.1 SQL Script to create MySQL CDR table for default "example" CDRs 

To confirm that the `mod_cdr_csv` is set for the "sql" template, check the file `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/cdr_csv.conf.xml`.

The default is the example template. If that is indeed the case, the script below is just what you will need to create a the cdr table.

**MySQL schema**

```xml
 CREATE TABLE cdr (
   caller_id_name varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
   caller_id_number varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
   destination_number varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
   context varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
   start_stamp datetime DEFAULT NULL,
   answer_stamp datetime DEFAULT NULL,
   end_stamp datetime DEFAULT NULL,
   duration int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
   billsec int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
   hangup_cause varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
   uuid varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
   bleg_uuid varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
   accountcode varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
   domain_name varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL
 ); 
```

For PostgreSQL

**PostgreSQL schema**

```xml
 CREATE TABLE cdr (
   caller_id_name character varying(30),
   caller_id_number character varying(30),
   destination_number character varying(30),
   context character varying(20),
   start_stamp timestamp without time zone,
   answer_stamp timestamp without time zone,
   end_stamp timestamp without time zone,
   duration integer,
   billsec integer,
   hangup_cause character varying(50),
   uuid uuid,
   bleg_uuid uuid,
   accountcode character varying(10),
   read_codec character varying(20),
   write_codec character varying(20)
 ); 
```

### 5.2 Perl Script for CDR into MySQL 

TODO Someone with a little knowledge of Perl could probably fix up all the `system()` and other hacks and lack of error checking...

Ensure the following line is uncommented in [cdr\_csv.conf.xml](../Configuration/CDR/index.mdx#about)

```xml
<param name="rotate-on-hup" value="true"/>
```

What this does is to allow the `Master.csv` and other CDR files to be rotated via the same method as used by the [mod\_logfile](./mod_logfile_1048990.mdx#about) method. The script below uses one of these methods to rotate the log file and load the file into a database. (The naming format for the rotated files is from e.g. `Master.csv` to `Master.csv.yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss`)

Create the script using the code below, and run through cron every minute if you like.

**Example Perl script**

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

    unlink $line;
}

# one silly thing is that each accountcode has its own cdr.csv as well, either handle those here, by loading them into their own tables, or rm them
my @BS  = ("xtec","megaphone","mafcom","xeivacom");
foreach my $code (@BS) {
   @LS = `ls -1t /usr/local/freeswitch/log/cdr-csv/$code.csv.*`;
   foreach my $line (@LS) {
       chop($line);
       #unlink($line);  #to delete
       move($line, "/usr/local/freeswitch/log/cdr-csv/trash/$code/"); # or move into a separate dir for later procession
   }
}
exit 0;
 
```

## Comments:

| /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/cdr\_csv.conf.xmlWhen I had modifed this config file, the only way to reload this file,just "**reload mod\_cdr\_csv**", what reload the mod\_cdr\_csv module, can work well. Has other command can reload the cdr\_csv.conf.xml ?Thanks ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by livem at Feb 24, 2017 04:22 |
