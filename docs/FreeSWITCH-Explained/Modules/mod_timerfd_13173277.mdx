# mod_timerfd 

 

## About

Mod\_timerfd uses the Linux kernel timerfd API to create and use a kernel timer that delivers timer expire notifications via a file descriptor.

Requires kernel >= 2.6.25, libc >= 2.8, and FreeSWITCH commit 48b1193552983e37f1724bd9a87d48ade5de74e5 or later.

You must enable it in switch.conf.xml with the param enable-softtimer-timerfd=true Or, enable it per channel with:

```xml
<action application="set" data="rtp_timer_name=timerfd"/>
```

### Testing TIMERFD feature in FreeSWITCH git

The TIMERFD feature is a linux specific feature to support timing in applications without using signals. I have no clue what specific advantages you get from this, but it's a new and modern way to do timing. So it must be very great :-)

Note that TIMERFD support is experimental and thus you should always use latest git when trying to use it.

To use the TIMERFD feature, you have to have a kernel with support for it. Check wether your kernel has such support with:

```xml
grep '^CONFIG_TIMERFD=' /boot/config-*
OR  zgrep CONFIG_TIMERFD= /proc/config.gz
```

If you kernel does not support TIMERFD feature, you will need to rebuild it or use a different build/kernel.

Secondly, you will need the FreeSWITCH support. There are two ways to get this, as native core support or as mod\_timerfd module.

#### TIMERFD support as mod_timerfd

To check wether the module is available, do:

```xml
find /usr/local/freeswitch/mod/ -name mod_timerfd.*
```

To build the mod\_timerfd in case it's not already there, add this line to your FreeSWITCH sources' modules.conf:

```xml
timers/mod_timerfd
```

Then build the module with this command:

```xml
make mod_timerfd
```

Finally install the module with this command:

```xml
make mod_timerfd-install
```

Then you need to configure FreeSWITCH to actually load the mod\_timerfd on startup. In /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml put a line like this:

```xml
<load module="mod_timerfd"/>
```

Then restart FreeSWITCH:

```xml
/etc/init.d/freeswitch restart
```

Alternatively load the module from the CLI:

```xml
/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli
load mod_timerfd
^D    
```

  
Verify wether timerfd timer is available when using mod\_timerfd:

```xml
freeswitch@internal> show timer
type,name,ikey
timer,soft,CORE_SOFTTIMER_MODULE
timer,timerfd,mod_timerfd

2 total.
```

### TIMERFD support natively in FreeSWITCH core

In the file /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/switch.conf.xml you have to put this:

```xml
<param name="enable-softtimer-timerfd" value="true"/>
```

FreeSWITCH should then use TIMERFD to implement normal soft timer.

WARNING! Don't use both TIMERFD support methods. I accidentally tried and got huge performance loss on incoming calls while RINGING. I got a severe lag in Xorg. As soon as call was hungup, the lag was gone. I think to use both methods at the same time is not meant to be done.
