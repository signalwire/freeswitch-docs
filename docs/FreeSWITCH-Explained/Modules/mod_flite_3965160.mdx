# About

Flite (aka Festival Lite) is a small embeddable TTS (Text to Speech) engine that's totally free.

Works on FreeBSD, Mac, Linux and Windows.

Don't load mod\_cepstral and mod\_flite at the same time. (symbol collision).

Voices are 16khz, and are:

* slt (female voice)
* rms (male voice)
* awb (male voice)
* kal (male voice)

# Installing mod_flite

In modules.conf:

* Uncomment asr\_tts/mod\_flite;

Edit the modules.conf at the top level of your src directory and NOT to be confused with the freeswitch/conf/modules.conf.xml file which you will also have to edit later - see below). This installation has been written assuming that you are going to be compiling this module.

Comment out asr\_tts/mod\_cepstral from the same file. Both modules cannot be used together.

* Run make, make install.

In freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml:

* Uncomment **&lt;load module="mod\_flite"/>**
* Comment out **&lt;load module="mod\_cepstral"/>**

# Using mod_flite

```xml
    <extension name="flite">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^9886$">
        <action application="set" data="tts_engine=flite"/>
        <action application="set" data="tts_voice=kal"/>
        <action application="speak" data="This is flite on FreeSWITCH"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
```

To set volume at your desired level:

```xml
 <action application="set_audio_level" data="write 4"/>
 <action application="set_audio_level" data="read 4"/>
```

write for output audio stream and read for incoming audio stream. read and write can take integral values from 4 to -4
