### Install & Configure 

There are two parts to making this works in FreeSwitch:

* mod\_say\_fr must be updated with the patch found [Here](http://jira.freeswitch.org/browse/FSCORE-528)
* You must download the sound files appropriate for your network (most people will want the 8000 Hz files) from [Here](http://www.archive.org/details/FrenchAudioFilesForFreeswitch)

The files were created by Sibylle Luperce & Philippe Leroy for [Neuronnexion.coop](http://Neuronnexion.coop), who put them under a Creative Commons license.

For additional recordings please contact Philippe Leroy.
