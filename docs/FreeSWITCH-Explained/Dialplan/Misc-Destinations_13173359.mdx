# Misc Destinations 

Create an extension that transfers to any number such as cell phone, home phone, or any number you wish.

/freeswitch/conf/dialplan/default.xml

```xml
 <extension name="8334">
 <condition field="destination_number" expression="8334">
 <action application="transfer" data="5551212 XML default"/>
 </condition>
 </extension>
```

Note: You should change the extension number to 8334 to one you would like as well as change the fake number 5551212 to something useful.
