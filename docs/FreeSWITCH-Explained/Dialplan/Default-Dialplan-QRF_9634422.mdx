# Default Dialplan QRF 

 

## About

The default dialplan (**conf/dialplan/default.xml**) sets up some basic functionality for testing and building a phone system.

This includes the ability to dial between extensions which are set up in the User Directory and to pseudo-destinations like the sample IVR, but does _not_ include the ability to dial out through a SIP carrier or TDM cards; you must add this to the dialplan before those types of calls will work.

The default dialplan also does not do anything useful with calls sent to your Freeswitch with a destination phone number attached, called "DID calls" for Direct Inward Dialling. You must modify/extend **conf/dialplan/public/public.xml** to route these calls to an extension.

Some of these are Bellcore/Telcordia CLASS [Vertical Service Codes](http://www.nanpa.com/number%5Fresource%5Finfo/vsc%5Fassignments.html).

Dial: 2001

### Call the billing group
