# Ring group

**Ring group** is PBX telephony jargon that refers to a group of physical telephones that all ring together, simultaneously, in response to calls made to an incoming telephone number (a.k.a. "DID", an acronym for Direct Inbound Dial).

A comma "," between endpoints causes "ring group" behavior, meaning all the extensions (phones) ring at once.

Note:

* If 2 or more phones are registered on one directory number (multiple registrations enabled), only one phone will ring when the directory number is called and numbers are separated by "," comma. If you wish to have all phones on the same extension number ring please use `colon underscore colon ":_:"` instead of "," comma.

  
This is related to a hunt group in which a call to the "pilot number" DID rings extensions in sequence, one at a time. Businesses typically advertise one telephone number, but have multiple unpublished numbers that "roll over" in series any busy/in-use lines. In this way, calls placed to the "main number" can be made to ring on a series of telephones.

A pipe character "|" between endpoints causes "hunt group" behavior, meaning the list of phones rings sequentially, one after another. You can also set a timeout variable. It may be possible to set a different timeout for each extension (in a long hunt group list), specifying the leg timeout inside brackets**.**

  
If the extensions don't change often, use the | separated list of endpoints.

Putting this line into ${`conf_dir}/dialplan/public/in.3015551212.xml` will cause incoming calls made to 301-555-1212 to ring on two extensions in Company A at the same time, x1021 and x1022:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/multi.domain-a.com/1021%${domain_name},sofia/multi.domain-a.com/1022%${domain_name}" />
```

  
Do not use the "user/" channel to form a group call dial string; instead, use the percent % symbol in place of the at @ symbol before the domain as shown in the example above.
