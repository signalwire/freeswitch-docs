# Ring group 

 


```xml
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/multi.domain-a.com/1021%${domain_name},sofia/multi.domain-a.com/1022%${domain_name}" />
```

  
Do not use the "user/" channel to form a group call dial string; instead, use the percent % symbol in place of the at @ symbol before the domain as shown in the example above.
