## Manipulating Groups from the Server

##### Adding an external number to a Call Group

Assuming that the local domain is set to [example.com](http://example.com), and you want the group to make a call to 01234555678 via a gateway called sipprivider, you can do it thus from the CLI:

```xml
group insert:01@example.com:[sip_cid_type=none]sofia/gateway/sipprovider/01234555678
```

This allows one to set things up so that extensions can be logged in/out using the above 8xxx codes, but the group always calls one's mobile(s)

##### Deleting from a Group

It is possible to delete items in a group using the 'group delete' command at the FreeSwitch CLI, but you need to know what's in the group. If it all goes horribly wrong, you can get rid of a call group by manipulating the SQL database directly. Assuming that you're using SQLight3, you can see the current state of play, thus:

```xml
# sqlite3 ~freeswitch/db/call_limit.db
sqlite> .headers ON
sqlite> select * from group_data;
hostname|groupname|url
voip|01@example.com|[sip_cid_type=none]sofia/gateway/sipprovider/01234555678
voip|01@example.com|sofia/internal/sip:1000@12.23.34.45:2048;line=abcde
```

and then discard (in this case) group [01@example.com](mailto:01@example.com) thus:

```xml
sqlite> delete from group_data where groupname = '01@example.com';
```
