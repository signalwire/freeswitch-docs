TODO Clear up what channel states and call states refer to exactly, and the connection between

\+ Headers `Channel-State*` and `Channel-Call-State*`   
\+ **Events** `CHANNEL_STATE` and `CHANNEL_CALLSTATE` 

See also corresponding TODOs in [Channel States](./Channel-States_7144639.mdx#0-about) and [Event List](../Introduction/Event-System/Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat)'s **3.1 CHANNEL\_CALLSTATE event** sections.

[See](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/15ad4c23e259c1c2dff58f89e9124e5f36dd2e94/src/switch%5Fchannel.c#L248) for the available call states (see snippet below), but not going to document it formally until knowing how the entities in the TODO relate to each other.

Some of the state names resemble the ones from [the sofia soa docs](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/15ad4c23e259c1c2dff58f89e9124e5f36dd2e94/libs/sofia-sip/libsofia-sip-ua/soa/soa.docs).  
  
```cpp
static struct switch_callstate_table CALLSTATE_CHART[] = {
	{"DOWN", CCS_DOWN},
	{"DIALING", CCS_DIALING},
	{"RINGING", CCS_RINGING},
	{"EARLY", CCS_EARLY},
	{"ACTIVE", CCS_ACTIVE},
	{"HELD", CCS_HELD},
	{"RING_WAIT", CCS_RING_WAIT},
	{"HANGUP", CCS_HANGUP},
	{"UNHELD", CCS_UNHELD},
	{NULL, 0}
};
