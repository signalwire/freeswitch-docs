# \_\_Channel Variables 

 

## About  

There are a number of channel variables that can be set in the dialplan or your application to affect the progress or settings for a call. Channel variables can also be set in dialstrings.

This page parallels the [\_\_Variables](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx) page. Consult both while the pages are being reconciled.

**\_\_Variables**

## Variable References

You will see references to variables in the dialplan of the form ${variable} as well as $${variable}.

$${variable} is evaluated once and becomes a static reference to the variable and is therefore suitable for variables that do not change, such as the domain of the FreeSWITCH server. That is why you see $${domain} referenced so frequently in the Vanilla dialplan examples and as pre-processor variables which are evaluated once at startup.

${variable} is evaluated during each pass through the dialplan, so it is used for variables that are expected to change, such as the ${destination\_number} or ${sip\_to\_user} fields.

  
#### Channel Variables in the XML Dialplan

Channel variables are set, appropriately enough, with the **set** application like this:

&lt;action application="set" data="var_name=var value"/>

Reading channel variables requires the `${}` syntax:

&lt;action application="log" data="INFO The value in the var_name chan var is ${var_name}"/>
&lt;condition field="${var_name}" expression="some text">

##### Scoped Variables

\- Channel variables used to be global to the session.  
\- With Scoped variables, you can now set variables that only exist for the duration of that single application execution and any subsequent applications under it.  
\- Applications can leverage this concept to use named input params  
  
As of June 15 (git commit b2c3199f) you may now have scoped variables that will stay in effect only for the duration of a given dialplan application. Example:

&lt;action application="log" data="INFO myvar is '${myvar}'"/>
&lt;action application="log" data="%[myvar=Hello]INFO myvar is '${myvar}'"/>
&lt;action application="log" data="INFO myvar is '${myvar}'"/>
&lt;action application="myapp" data="%[var1=val1,var2=val2]mydata"/>

#### Channel Variables in Dial strings

The syntax of using { } versus &lt; > versus \[\] is explained below.

* {foo=bar} is **only** valid at the beginning of the dial string. It will set the same variables on **every** channel, but does not do so for enterprise bridging/originate.
* &lt;foo=bar> is **only** valid at the beginning of the dial string. It will set the same variables on **every** channel, including all those in an enterprise bridging/originate.
* \[foo=bar\] goes before each individual dial string and will set the variable values specified for only this channel.
* The following example sets the foo variable for all channels implemented and chan=1 is specific to blah, while chan=2 is specific to blah2

{foo=bar}[chan=1]sofia/default/blah@baz.com,[chan=2]sofia/default/blah2@baz.com

* Setting multiple variables can be accomplished by comma delimiting:

[var1=abc,var2=def,var3=ghi]sofia/default/blah@baz.com

* If you would like to have variables in \[\] override the same variables set in {}, you may set 'local\_var\_clobber=true' inside {}. For example:

{local_var_clobber=true,rtp_secure_media=true}sofia/default/blah1@baz.com|sofia/default/johndoe@example.com|[rtp_secure_media=false]sofia/default/janedoe@acme.com

You must also set this _local\_var\_clobber_ variable to true when you want to override channel variables that have been exported to your b-legs in your dialplan.

In this example, the legs for [blah1@baz.com](mailto:blah1@baz.com) and [johndoe@example.com](mailto:johndoe@example.com) would be set to offer SRTP (RTP/SAVP) while [janedoe@acme.com](mailto:janedoe@acme.com) would not receive an SRTP offer (she would see RTP/AVP instead).

##### Handling Variables With Commas

Since commas are the default delimiter inside of {} and \[\] it is necessary to have an alternate means of delimiting values that actually contain commas.

To set a variable with a "," inside of it (e.g. the absolute\_codec\_string), you must tell FreeSWITCH what delimiter to use instead for THIS value.

The syntax is to put a prefix of ^^: at the start of the value and replace the _commas in the value_ with ":". Then, FreeSWITCH will substitute commas back in when setting the value for the channel.

You can use (almost) any character you like though, it uses the one after the initial "^^"

{absolute_codec_string=^^:PCMA@8000h@20i@64000b:PCMU@8000h@20i@64000b:G729@8000h@20i@8000b,leg_time_out=10,process_cdr=b_only}

This approach however does not work when you are setting sip\_h\_, sip\_rh\_ and sip\_ph headers. If you want to pass a comma into the contents of a private header then you must escape the comma with a preceding backslash:

{sip_h_X-My-Header=one\,two\,three,leg_time_out=10,process_cdr=b_only}

#### Exporting Channel Variables in Bridge Operations

You can export a variable from one call leg (A) to the other call leg (B) by using the 'export\_vars' variable which is a comma separated list of variables that you wish to propagate across calls. Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="export_vars=myvar,myvar2,foo,bar"/>

You can also set a variable on the (A) leg and add it to the export list in one step with the export application:

&lt;action application="export" data="myvar=true"/>

#### Using Channel Variables in Dialplan Condition Statements

Channel variables can be used in conditions:

* See [XML Dialplan#Conditions](../XML-Dialplan/index.mdx#conditions) for specifics.
* Keep in mind that some channel variables may not be set during the dialplan parsing phase. See [XML Dialplan#InlineActions](../XML-Dialplan/index.mdx#inline-actions) for more information.

#### Custom Channel Variables

Additionally, you may set any number of unique channel variables for your own purposes and even elect to log them to the CDR. In order to set any channel variable, use the application "set" to effect the setting. You can also set channel variables on the command issued via XML-RPC or Event Socket by adding {myvar=myval,myvar1=myval1} e.g.

originate {ignore_early_media=true}sofia/mydomain.com/18005551212@1.2.3.4 15555551212

If the value you are setting has a space in it then you will need to enclose the value in quotes. For example:

originate {fax_ident=1231231234,fax_header='Fax Test'}sofia/gateway/outbound.fax/1004 &txfax(/tmp/fax.tiff)

#### Channel Variable Manipulation

Channel variables can be manipulated for varied results. For example, you can trim bits and pieces of a channel variable, perhaps to get the first three digits of a phone number. See [Manipulating Channel Variables](../Manipulating-Channel-Variables_13173332.mdx#search-and-replace) for more information.

#### Channel Variable Scope w/ Example

Consider the following example that shows where each application sets it's variable :

  &lt;extension name="test" continue="false">
     &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^test([0-9]+)$">
       &lt;action application="set" data="fruit=tomato" /> &lt;!-- Set variable in local channel -->
       &lt;action application="export" data="veggie=tomato" /> &lt;!-- Set variable in local channel and export it to new channels we bridge to -->
       &lt;action application="bridge" data="{meat=tomato}sofia/gateway/testaccount/1234" />&lt;!-- bridge new channel and set variable only in new channel -->
     &lt;/condition>
   &lt;/extension>

Leg A ( the channel that called the dial plan ) will have the following variables set :

fruit: tomato
veggie: tomato

Leg B ( the channel created with sofia/gateway/testaccount/1234 ) will have the following variables set :

veggie: tomato
meat: tomato

#### Accessing Channel Variables in Other Environments

In addition to the dialplan, you can get at channel variables in other environments as well.

**In a FreeSWITCH module**, written in C, you would use:

  switch_channel_set_variable(channel,"name","value");  
  char* result = switch_channel_get_variable(channel,"name");    
  char* result = switch_channel_get_variable_partner(channel,"name");

**In the console** (or fs\_cli, implemented in mod\_commands), you can use:

` uuid_getvar <uuid> <name>`  
` uuid_setvar <uuid> <name> [<value>]`  
` uuid_setvar_multi <uuid> <name>=<value>[;<name>=<value>[;...]]`

Alternatively, you can call `uuid_dump` to get _all_ the variables, or you can use the `eval` command, adding the prefix `variable_` to your key:

  uuid_dump &lt;uuid>  
  eval uuid:&lt;uuid> ${variable_&lt;name>}

**In an event socket**, just extend the above with the '`api`' prefix.

  api uuid_getvar &lt;uuid> &lt;name> 

**In Lua**, there are several ways to interact with variables. In the `freeswitch.Session()` invocation that creates a new `Session` object, variables go in square brackets:

  s = freeswitch.Session("[myname=myvars]sofia/localhost/1003");

Once you have a `Session` object you can call the

  result = session:getVariable(“name");  
  session:setVariable(“name","value");

methods. The variables actually belong to the channel object that is bonded to the session, but since there is a one-to-one binding, Lua treats sessions and channels as a single object.

  
### Info Application Variable Names (variable_xxxx)

Some variables, as shown from the [info app](../../Modules/mod-dptools/6587023.mdx#about), may have variable\_ in front of their names. For example, if you pass a header variable called 'type' from the proxy server, it will get displayed as 'variable\_sip\_h\_type' in FreeSWITCH. To access that variable, you should strip off the variable\_, and just do ${sip\_h\_type}. Other variables shown in the info app are prepended with channel, which should be stripped as well. The example below show a list of info app variables and the corresponding channel variable names:

| **Info variable name**                    | **channel variable name**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### ${variable} vs. $${variable}

${variables} are channel variables that may be set in the dialplan, application or directory that affect call progress or settings.

$${variables} are expanded when the master freeswitch.xml is compiled. This happens when you start FreeSWITCH, or when _reloadxml_ is called.

The key is that $${variables} are evaluated \*once\* by the pre-processor, and ${variables} are evaluated fresh each time they are executed (for example when a call connects).

### CDR related

#### [process_cdr](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#2-show-variables) 

**Indicates how to process CDR records.**

Can be undefined or set to "false", "true", "a\_only", "b\_only"

* false - indicates to not process the record.
* true - or undefined indicates the default behavior which is to process all CDR records.
* a\_only - indicates to only process CDR records on the inbound leg of a call.
* b\_only - indicates to only process CDR records on the outbound leg of a call.

_This variable is unconditionally exported._

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="process_cdr=a_only"/>

####   

#### [accountcode](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about) 

Account code is mostly an arbitrary value that you can assign on a per leg basis. An important feature of _accountcode_ is that if its value matches one of the CDR CSV templates defined in **cdr\_csv.conf.xml** then that CDR template will be used when generating a CSV CDR.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="accountcode=custom"/>

  
#### [hold_events](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#2-show-variables) 

It's a variable that display start and stop times for each hold.

  
**Example:**

This CDR shows that the phone was put on hold twice with hold start and stop time.

```xml
variable_hold_events: [{{1347487292379229,1347487293856872},{1347487288539686,1347487290757780}}]

### Hangup Causes

#### [bridge_hangup_cause](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about) 

This is set to the hangup cause of the last bridged B leg of the call. If you have continue\_on\_fail=true and hangup\_after\_bridge=false you can do checks on this to see what "really" happened to the call. You can for instance do execute\_extension after bridge, do a condition check on ${bridge\_hangup\_cause} to see if it contains MEDIA\_TIMEOUT and then trigger a redial of the call or transfer to a cell phone. For a list of hangup causes, see [Hangup Causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about) \[[old wiki](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Hangup%5FCauses)\].

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="log" data="1 B-leg hangup cause: ${bridge_hangup_cause}"/>

  
#### [disable_q850_reason](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about) 

When set to true, this disables sending of the Reason header, which includes the Q.850 reason code, in responses and BYEs. For a list of hangup causes and their Q.850 codes, see [Hangup Causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about). This is available as of revision 15850 committed 12/8/2009.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="disable_q850_reason=true"/>

  
#### [hangup_cause](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#2-show-variables) 

This is set to the hangup cause of the A leg of the call (note that as such it doesn't make much sense before the end of the call). Often this will take the hangup cause from the B leg of the call, if there is one. For a list of hangup causes, see [Hangup Causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about).

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="log" data="1 A-leg hangup cause: ${hangup_cause}"/>

  
#### [hangup_cause_q850](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#2-show-variables) 

This is set to the Q850 numeric code of the hangup cause of the A leg of the call (note that as such it doesn't make much sense before the end of the call). Often this will take the hangup cause from the B leg of the call, if there is one. For a list of hangup causes, see [Hangup Causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about).

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="log" data="1 A-leg hangup Q850 cause: ${hangup_cause_q850}"/>

  
#### [sip_hangup_disposition](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about) 

This variable contains the value of who sent the SIP BYE message. Some examples from XML CDRs:

&lt;sip_hangup_disposition>send_bye&lt;/sip_hangup_disposition>
&lt;sip_hangup_disposition>recv_bye&lt;/sip_hangup_disposition>
&lt;sip_hangup_disposition>send_refuse&lt;/sip_hangup_disposition>
&lt;sip_hangup_disposition>send_cancel&lt;/sip_hangup_disposition>

Interpretation of these values differs on incoming and outgoing calls since FreeSWITCH is at different ends of the session.

| Value        | Incoming                                       | Outgoing                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| send\_bye    | FS sent BYE to the caller (we hung up)         | FS sent BYE to the endpoint (we hung up)         |
| recv\_bye    | FS received BYE from the caller (they hung up) | FS received BYE from the endpoint (they hung up) |
| send\_refuse | FS rejected the call (e.g. 4xx or 5xx)         | Endpoint rejected the call (e.g. 4xx or 5xx)     |
| send\_cancel | _n/a_                                          | FS aborted the call (we sent CANCEL)             |

**Usage:**

Look in CDR for the value; only valid after call has ended.

  
#### [proto_specific_hangup_cause](../../Introduction/Variables/index.mdx#0-about) 

This variable will cause FreeSWITCH to force the SIP response code to a specific setting when hanging up a call. The example below is one where all possible extensions have been tested and failed and you want FreeSWITCH to generate and respond with a specific code. (This is not a passthrough example).

By the way, you'll be unable to rewrite the hangup cause for a bridge that gets a 180 or 183 packet from the gateway before getting a 4xx, 5xx or 6xx packet (because those bridges don't 'fail'). This happens with SIP providers that give a 183 Session Progress before a 404 Not Found if the PSTN number dialled doesn't exist.

**Usage:**

```xml
<extension name="nothing_left" continue="true">
  <condition break="always">
    <action application="set" data="proto_specific_hangup_cause=sip:503"/>
    <action application="hangup"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

  
**Example:**   
SIP Response Map

```xml
 <extension name="from_gw_to_internal">
     <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(.*)$">
       <action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
       <action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=19"/>
       <action application="bridge" data="{sip_cid_type=none}sofia/gateway/gw/$1"/>
       <action application="transfer" data="480to503"/>
     </condition>
   </extension>

   <extension name="480to503">

### DTMF Related

#### [pass_rfc2833](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#pass_rfc2833) 

If set, it passes [RFC 2833](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2833) DTMF's from one side of a bridge to the other, untouched. If unset, it decodes and re-encodes them before passing them on.

Note: this has no effect when bypass\_media or proxy\_media is set.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="pass_rfc2833=true"/>

  
#### [dtmf_type](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#dtmf_type)

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="dtmf_type=rfc2833"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="dtmf_type=none"/>

  
#### [drop_dtmf](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#drop_dtmf) 

Set this on an inbound channel before answer or on an outbound channel before the bridge/originate in order to prevent DTMF events from being sent to the channel.

Only tested with RFC2833, may also work for INFO / inband. See Jira issue FS-4769\. Commit 60f7849cbe72.

### Media Handling

#### [monitor_early_media_fail](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#monitor_early_media_fail) 

Monitors early media for failure conditions, such as a busy signal. This allows faster processing of failed calls when ignoring early media.

The syntax is a series of ! delimited early media conditions in the following format:

[condition\_name:number\_of\_hits:tone\_detect\_frequencies](http://condition%5Fnamenumber%5Fof%5Fhitstone%5Fdetect%5Ffrequencies)

| condition\_name           | user defined name for the error condition                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| number\_of\_hits          | the number of times the tone must be heard before considering it a fail                                                                                                                       |
| tone\_detect\_frequencies | the frequencies to listen for (delimited by + instead of ,). See [tone\_detect](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Ftone%5Fdetect "Misc. Dialplan Tools tone detect") |

NOTE: this variable only works when ignore\_early\_media is set to true.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{ignore_early_media=true,monitor_early_media_fail=user_busy:2:480+620!destination_out_of_order:2:1776.7}sofia/dial/string"/>

  
#### [monitor_early_media_ring](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#monitor_early_media_ring) 

Monitors early media for a user-specific ring tone. Each time the tone is heard, the switch will increment an internal counter for that leg. Once the counter reaches[ monitor\_early\_media\_ring\_total](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fmonitor%5Fearly%5Fmedia%5Fring%5Ftotal "Variable monitor early media ring total") (or this variable has not been set) then the early media will be sent.

The syntax is a series of ! delimited early media conditions in the following format:

[condition\_name:number\_of\_hits:tone\_detect\_frequencies](http://condition%5Fnamenumber%5Fof%5Fhitstone%5Fdetect%5Ffrequencies)

| condition\_name           | Optional? user-defined name for the error condition                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| number\_of\_hits          | the number frequencies for the tone detector to find before considering it a hit. 1:400.0+480.0 means the ring count is incremented if 400hz OR 480hz is detected. 2:400.0+480.0 means the ring count is incremented if 400 hz AND 480 hz are detected. |
| tone\_detect\_frequencies | the frequencies to listen for (delimited by + instead of ,). Examples are 400.0+480.0 \[for a US Ring\] See [tone\_detect](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Ftone%5Fdetect "Misc. Dialplan Tools tone detect")                |

NOTE: this variable only works when ignore\_early\_media is not present.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{monitor_early_media_ring_total=3,monitor_early_media_ring=usring:1:440.0+480.0!ukring:2:400+450}sofia/gateway/yourgateway/1239@conference.freeswitch.org"/>

  
### Timeout Related

#### [call_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#call_timeout) 

Controls how long (in seconds) to ring the B leg of a call when using the bridge application. The timeout is set on the A leg, and applies to any bridges that happen in the channel.

If you need to set a timeout on a call that has no A leg, use [originate\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Foriginate%5Ftimeout "Variable originate timeout")

If you need to set a timeout with enterprise bridging/originate, use [originate\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Foriginate%5Ftimeout "Variable originate timeout")

If you need to set the timeout on a per leg basis (i.e., a different timeout for each destination), use the [leg\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fleg%5Ftimeout "Variable leg timeout") variable.

Default Value: 60

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="call_timeout=20"/>

  
#### [leg_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#leg_timeout) 

Timeout for each leg in an originate dialstring. Can be used in per-leg \[\], but not in global {} for the dialstring. For global, use [originate\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Foriginate%5Ftimeout "Variable originate timeout").

You can also use leg\_progress\_timeout to specify the maximum time we will wait before we get media (whether its early media, ringing or answer), allowing you to avoid going to voicemail for a particular line.

If you are using group confirm then you can cancel the timeout by using the [group\_confirm\_cancel\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Channel%5FVariables#group%5Fconfirm%5Fcancel%5Ftimeout "Channel Variables") channel variable. If leg\_delay\_start is also used, leg\_timeout will not start the timeout counter until after the extension starts to be bridged to.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="[leg_timeout=15]user/hastoanswerquickly/some.domain.com,[leg_timeout=60]user/hasaminutetoanswer@some.domain.com"/>

  
#### [originate_continue_on_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#originate_continue_on_timeout) 

Controls wether or not a bridge should continue after timing out. Default value is false. This variable resets the timeout after each | default is to die on first timeout

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="originate_continue_on_timeout=true"/>

  
#### [park_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#park_timeout) 

When set, a parked call will disconnect after the timeout has occurred. Timeout is specified in seconds. If no park\_timeout value is set then the parked call will be held indefinitely or until it is removed with a uuid\_transfer.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="park_timeout=30"/>
&lt;action application="park"/>

You can also specify which hangup\_cause you need when the channel is disconnected by park\_timeout.

**Usage:** &lt;action application="set" data="park\_timeout=30:MEDIA\_TIMEOUT"/>

  
### Music On Hold Related

#### [hold_music](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_hold_music)  

Per-channel hold music. Supports all audio formats and audio streams. The hold\_music variable can also be set globally at vars.xml.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="hold_music=/sounds/holdmusic.wav" />

You can also set your hold\_music to the special value "indicate\_hold" instead of a music source and it will pass the hold req through but not the SDP.

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="hold_music=silence" />

You can also use 'phrase:' to indicate to use a phrase instead of a specific file

&lt;action application="set" data="hold_music=phrase:my_hold_music" />

For multi-tenant environment, if you want to have a separate MOH for the phone with hold button (like Polycom) that utilizes RE-INVITE with no media ip addr (0.0.0.0) for hold, you can override the hold-music values in the sip profile parameter similar to the following example:

&lt;action application="bridge_export" data="hold_music=$${sounds_dir}/music/company-a.mp3"/>

  
#### [temp_hold_music](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#temp_hold_music) 

This variable specifies a hold music value that gets played to a caller only until they get transferred. After the transfer, the hold\_music variable will apply.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="temp_hold_music=local_stream://alternate_moh"/>

  
### Locale Related

#### [default_language](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#default_language) 

Controls the default language the Say Phrase engine will use when no language is explicitly specified in the API call. This permits you to easily support multiple languages by only changing a single variable at call time.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="default_language=fr"/>

  
#### [timezone](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#timezone) 

Sets the timezone for this particular call. Can be used, e.g., to set the timezone for a caller who is checking his/her voicemail. The value is expressed in Linux timezone format (ex. America/New\_York -- see /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab for the standard list of Linux timezones).

Note that this channel variable is only respected by the phrase layer -- ie, if you're using the 'say' application to announce times, this will work fine.

You can set the time zone Globally for Freeswitch in /conf/vars.xml by adding this line: &lt;X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="timezone=America/Toronto"/> (of course replace the 'America/Toronto' with your own time zone.

If you would like to specify the time zone in the dialplan add &lt;action application="set" data="timezone=America/Toronto"/> to your dialplan. (again replace with the proper timezone)

Finally you can specify a time zone for a particular extension in /conf/directory/default/'extension'.xml

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="timezone=GMT0"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="timezone=America/New_York"/>

  
#### [tod_tz_offset](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#tod_tz_offset) 

Sets the GMT offset to be used on this call for tod based conditions.

NOTE: the variable must actually be set before the comparison, so either set it inline, transfer, or set it in the user directory.

  
You can set the offset Globally for Freeswitch in /conf/vars.xml by adding this line: &lt;X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="tod\_tz\_offset=5"/> (of course replace the '5' with your GMT offset.

If you would like to specify the time offset in the dialplan add &lt;action application="set" data="tod\_tz\_offset=5"/> to your dialplan. (again replace with the proper offset)

Finally you can set the variable for a particular extension in /conf/directory/default/'extension'.xml

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="tod_tz_offset=5"/>

  
### Bridge Related

#### [api_after_bridge](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#api_after_bridge) 

Execute an API command after bridge.

  
**Usage:**

Paging to PA System via Portaudio (w/ chime before and after announcement) [[1]](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fportaudio#PA%5FSystem%5Fw.2F%5FChime)

  
#### [auto_hunt](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#auto_hunt) 

Setting auto\_hunt to "true" will alter the normal sequential processing of dialplan extensions. auto\_hunt will cause the dialplan to 'jump' to a specific **extension name**, not processing any other extension. The destination\_number and extension name must be the same in order for this to work. The condition must still match, but the extension name is the operative element.

In the example below, there is no way to reach extension 333 without auto\_hunt.

**Usage:** In vars.xml:

&lt;X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="auto_hunt=true"/>

**Example:**

```xml
<extension name="do_xfer">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^.*$">
    <action application="set" data="auto_hunt=true"/>
    <action application="transfer" data="333"/>
  </condition>
</extension>

<extension name="333">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^333$">
    <action application="info"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

  
#### [bridge_early_media](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#bridge_early_media) 

By default this is false. Set to true, this makes the bridge use the live audio from the b-leg as ringback to the a-leg. Setting bridge\_early\_media=true means the early media will be buffered.

Consider setting this to true if you are using a loopback channel to execute a bridge to an endpoint which sends back early media and the received early media's audio is degraded. The buffering resulting from setting bridge\_early\_media=true brings with it a higher resource cost (than bridge\_early\_media=false), but may improve the sound quality of the early media.

**Usage:** Set bridge\_early\_media before the bridge, or in the dial string for the bridge.

  
#### [bridge_filter_dtmf](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#bridge_filter_dtmf) 

Setting this variable to true will prevent DTMF digits received on this channel when bridged from being sent to the other channel.

**Usage:**

You can set this variable in the dialplan before answering or inline as part of a dialstring.

Example dialplan usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="bridge_filter_dtmf=true" />

Example dialstring usage:

{bridge_filter_dtmf=true}sofia/default/blah@baz.com

  
#### [bridge_terminate_key](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#bridge_terminate_key) 

Allows you to bind a key and the bridge will terminate if the dtmf matches

**Usage:** you can set bridge\_terminate\_key on either or both legs which will end the bridge, if it hangs up or not is decided by hangup\_after\_bridge=false or what is next in your dp

  
#### [continue_on_fail](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#continue_on_fail) 

Controls what happens when the called party can not be reached (busy/offline). If "true" the dialplan continues to be processed. If "false" the dialplan will stop processing. Can contain the return messages that will continue on fail also.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=NORMAL_TEMPORARY_FAILURE,USER_BUSY,NO_ANSWER,NO_ROUTE_DESTINATION"/>

or Q.850 cause codes,

&lt;action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=3,17,18,27"/>

  
#### [transfer_on_fail](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#transfer_on_fail) 

Allows you to transfer call flow when a called party can not be reached for specific reasons ( unallocated\_number, etc )

Please note, you will need to set failure\_causes variable too.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="failure_causes=UNALLOCATED_NUMBER"/>  
&lt;action application="set" data="transfer_on_fail=UNALLOCATED_NUMBER"/>

in this example, if you were to attempt a bridge that resulted in "UNALLOCATED\_NUMBER" , the call flow would be "transferred" to the "UNALLOCATED\_NUMBER" destination in your current dialplan ( probably default xml dialplan )

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="transfer_on_fail=&lt;hangupcauses> &lt;destination> &lt;dialplan> &lt;context>"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="transfer_on_fail=1"/>

  
#### [enable_file_write_buffering](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#enable_file_write_buffering) 

Enable file buffering when recording a file, defaults to true if not set.

Buffer size defaults to \`SWITCH\_DEFAULT\_FILE\_BUFFER\_LEN\` but can be overridden by putting bytes size instead of true (see below example).

Related discussion; <http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2012-April/082835.html>
  
  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=false"/> 
&lt;action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=true"/> 
&lt;action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=65535"/> 

  
#### [failure_causes](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#failure_causes) 

Controls which failure causes will be considered as a failure to the bridge(s). This will change the values for which [continue\_on\_fail](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fcontinue%5Fon%5Ffail "Variable continue on fail") will fail by default unless [continue\_on\_fail](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fcontinue%5Fon%5Ffail "Variable continue on fail") is set to true.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="failure_causes=USER_BUSY,NO_ANSWER"/>

or Q.850 cause codes,

&lt;action application="set" data="failure_causes=487"/>

  
#### [force_transfer_context](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#force_transfer_context) 

When handling transfer/REFER FreeSWITCH normally inherits the context from the original channel. This variable forces the context in which to handle the transfer/REFER

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{force_transfer_context=some_context}sofia/gateway/gw_name/12345"/>

  
#### [force_transfer_dialplan](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#force_transfer_dialplan) 

When handling transfer/REFER FreeSWITCH normally inherits the diaplan from the original channel. This variable forces the dialplan in which to handle the transfer/REFER

**Usage:**

Example needed! Please contribute one.

  
#### [hangup_after_bridge](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#hangup_after_bridge) 

Controls what happens to a calling (A) party when in a bridge state and the called (B) party hangs up. If "true" the dialplan will stop processing and the A leg will be terminated when the B leg terminates. If "false" (default) the dialplan continues to be processed after the B leg terminates. This is checked after [park\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fpark%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable park after bridge") and [transfer\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Ftransfer%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable transfer after bridge").

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>

  
#### [hold_hangup_xfer_exten](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#hold_hangup_xfer_exten) 

Controls what happens to a calling (A) party when in a bridge state and the bridge ends while the called (B) party is on hold. If not set on leg B (ie. the default), then A leg is hung up. If it is set on leg B, then leg A is transferred to the given extension, as per [transfer\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Ftransfer%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable transfer after bridge").

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="hold_hangup_xfer_exten=1000:XML:default"/>

  
#### [last_bridge_to](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#signal_bridge_to) 

[Variable last bridge to](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/index.php?title=Variable%5Flast%5Fbridge%5Fto&action=edit&redlink=1 "Variable last bridge to (page does not exist)")

####  loopback_bowout_on_execute 

Set to true to have one-legged loopback channels "bow out" (remove the loopback legs) of the call.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="loopback_bowout_on_execute=true"/>

Remarks:

loopback\_bowout\_on\_execute is only useful to single leg calls, you never have to set it. loopback\_bowout is true by default. It tries to remove loopback by doing uuid\_bridge.

When setting "loopback\_bowout=false", a bridged loopback call results in 4 legs (a-leg, loopback-a, loopback-b, b-leg).

When setting "loopback\_bowout=true", a bridged loopback call results in 2 legs (a-leg, b-leg).

During the call setup phase even with "loopback\_bowout=true" there will always be 4 legs, however. loopback-a and loopback-b will be destroyed when a-leg and b-leg are successfully bridged

#### [loopback_export](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#loopback_export) 

A list of channel variables to pass from loopback-a to loopback-b.

  
**Usage:**

  
#### [outbound_redirect_fatal](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#outbound_redirect_fatal) 

When doing a simultaneous call to multiple endpoints, a 302 redirect can cause all the endpoints to stop ringing and the call will follow the redirect. When this channel variable is set it causes an endpoint that sends back a 302 redirect to be removed from the call list and the other endpoints continue to ring.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{outbound_redirect_fatal=true}${group_call(sales@$${domain})}"/>
  
  
#### [originate_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#originate_timeout) 

Determines how long a bridge or originate action action will stay in the "originate" state. In effect, it is a way to control the timeout for a bridge/originate consisting of multiple endpoints. Default value is 60.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{originate_timeout=10}[leg_timeout=5]sofia/default/foo1@bar1|[leg_timeout=5]sofia/default/foo2@bar2"/>

  
**Example**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{originate_timeout=24}${group_call(sales@$${domain})}"/>

#### [park_after_bridge](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#park_after_bridge) 

If set to true, it will [park](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fpark "Misc. Dialplan Tools park") the call after [bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fbridge "Misc. Dialplan Tools bridge") returns. This is checked before [transfer\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Ftransfer%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable transfer after bridge") and [hangup\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fhangup%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable hangup after bridge").

Default: false

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="park_after_bridge=true"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>

  
#### [signal_bond](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#signal_bond) 

UUID of the channel this channel is bridged/bonded to. Not present on a one-legged call.

**Usage:**

Example needed! Please contribute one.

**See also:**
  
  
#### [no_throttle_limits](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#no_throttle_limits) 

You set this variable to true on your outbound calls to have them not count in sps

**Usage:**

{no_throttle_limits=true}

####  origination_nested_vars 

_Description needed! Please contribute one._

#### The execute_on family

The execute\_on\_xx variables will execute dialplan applications on various conditions. As of April 1, 2011 these variables support a new syntax that allows multiple applications for a single condition. Example:

**Example**

```xml
<action application="set" data="execute_on_answer_1=app1 arg"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_answer_2=app2 arg"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_answer_3=app3 arg"/>
```

Note: please be careful not to abuse this feature! There are cases where you could end up blocking the session thread and bad things could happen. If you find that you are trying to do lots and lots of things with these then consider using an execute_extension app and doing your stuff in a dialplan extension.

##### [execute_on_answer](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#execute_on_answer) 

Execute an application (not an api) when the called party answers. To set an api, use [api\_on\_answer](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fapi%5Fon%5Fanswer "Variable api on answer"). execute\_on\_answer will also allow for more control when dealing with no answer conditions in cases where you cannot ignore early media.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with nolocal: prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds while manually ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_answer=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>

or, to wait 30 seconds for an answer while 'manually' ignoring early media

originate {ignore_early_media=true}sofia/gateway/my_gateway/5551212 885551212

&lt;extension name="exe_on_ans">

    &lt;action application="log" data="INFO Call to $1 was not answered, taking alternative action..."/>
    &lt;action application="transfer" data="UNANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
  &lt;/condition>
&lt;/extension>

  
##### [execute_on_media](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#execute_on_media) 

Execute an application when the far end sends media, i.e. ringing or 183/SDP.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with nolocal: prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds without ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>

or, to wait 30 seconds for an answer without ignoring early media

originate sofia/gateway/my_gateway/5551212 885551212

&lt;extension name="exe_on_ans">
  &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^88(\d+)$">
    &lt;action application="set" data="execute_on_media=transfer ANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
    &lt;action application="log" data="INFO Waiting 30 seconds for $1 to answer..."/>
    &lt;action application="sleep" data="30000"/>
    &lt;action application="log" data="INFO Call to $1 was not answered, taking alternative action..."/>
    &lt;action application="transfer" data="UNANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
  &lt;/condition>
&lt;/extension>

  
##### [execute_on_media_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#execute_on_media_timeout) 

Execute an application if the far end stops sending media and times out.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media_timeout=lua oops_timeout.lua ${uuid}"/>
&lt;action application="set" data="execute_on_media_timeout=transfer HANDLE_MEDIA_TIMEOUT XML default"/>

  
##### [execute_on_pre_answer](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#execute_on_pre_answer) 

Execute an application (not an api) when the called party "preanswers" - that is, when some form of early media is coming or the far end sends a 180 Ringing.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with nolocal: prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds without ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_pre_answer=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>

#### The api_on family

The api\_on\_xx variables will execute FreeSWITCH APIs on various conditions.

##### [api_on_answer](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#api_on_answer) 

Execute an api (not an application) when the called party answers. To set an application, use [execute\_on\_answer](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fexecute%5Fon%5Fanswer "Variable execute on answer").

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:api_on_answer=uuid_broadcast ${uuid} beep.wav both"/>

Or,

 &lt;action application="bridge" data="{api_on_answer='uuid_broadcast ${uuid} beep.wav both'}sofia/gateway/provider/5551231234"/>

  
##### [api_on_media](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#api_on_media) 

Execute a FreeSWITCH API when the far end sends media, i.e. ringing or 183/SDP.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with nolocal: prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds without ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>

  
#####  api_on_originate

#####  api_on_post_originate

#####  api_on_pre_answer

#####  api_on_pre_originate

#####  api_on_ring 

**api\_on\_sip\_extra\_headers**

**api\_on\_tone\_detect**

  
#### [failed_xml_cdr_prefix](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#failed_xml_cdr_prefix) 

If you set that on the A leg and any and all failed B originates generate a full XML CDR report and set it as a variable, this includes during a forked dial.

So say you try to call sofia/profile/a@xxxxxxx,sofia/profile/b@xxxxxxx

And it fails completely, before you make the call you set failed\_xml\_cdr\_prefix to "bad\_call"

Then you end up with ${bad\_call\_1} and ${bad\_call\_2} which are each a full XML report including all the vars etc.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="failed_xml_cdr_prefix=failinggw" />	

  
#### [fail_on_single_reject](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fail_on_single_reject) 

This is useful when using the "," AND operator in the DATA field of a bridge. The AND operator notifies a list of destinations, bridging to the first destination that accepts the call. Typically if a destination in the list rejects the call, the bridge will continue to be attempted until either another destination accepts the call, or a timeout occurs. See below for an example of using fail\_on\_single\_reject with the "|" OR operator.

This variable allows one to terminate the bridging attempt on a single rejection of the call. This means the bridge attempt would fail, and if continue\_on\_fail has not been set, the call is terminated. This variable would be set within a condition before a bridge application. When used in conjunction with the continue\_on\_fail variable, one can perform operations such as rolling over a rejected caller to an answering machine application.

The default setting is FALSE, meaning a single rejection will not terminate the bridging attempt.

It can also be set to a list of [failure causes](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Hangup%5Fcauses "Hangup causes") to stop on, and can be negated to a list of causes not to stop on (i.e. stop on all other failure causes).

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=true"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/$${profile}/$${kitchen}%$${domain},sofia/$${profile}/$${dining}%$${domain}"/>
&lt;action application="javascript" data="answermachine.js"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=USER_BUSY"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!NORMAL_CIRCUIT_CONGESTION"/>

or to use a list,

&lt;action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=^^:CALL_REJECTED:NORMAL_CLEARING:USER_BUSY"/>

or for negated list,

&lt;action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!^^:ALLOTTED_TIMEOUT:NETWORK_OUT_OF_ORDER"/>

For use with the OR operator, consider the following example. Here the dialplan sends a call to multiple gateways simultaneously. In the case of GATEWAY\_DOWN or INVALID\_GATEWAY the bridge should not fail (i.e. negated fail\_on\_single\_reject) and the dialplan should continue (i.e. continue\_on\_fail):

&lt;action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=GATEWAY_DOWN,INVALID_GATEWAY"/>  
&lt;action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!^^:GATEWAY_DOWN:INVALID_GATEWAY"/>  
&lt;action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>  
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/gw1/$1|sofia/gateway/gw2/$1|sofia/gateway/gw3/$1"/>
  
  
#### [intercept_unbridged_only](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#intercept_unbridged_only) 

If set to true, the leg will only be [intercepted](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fintercept "Misc. Dialplan Tools intercept") if the channel is not [bridged](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fbridge "Misc. Dialplan Tools bridge") to anyone.

Default: false

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="intercept_unbridged_only=true"/>
&lt;action application="intercept" data="myUUID"/>

  
#### [intercept_unanswered_only](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#intercept_unanswered_only) 

If set to true, the leg will only be [intercepted](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fintercept "Misc. Dialplan Tools intercept") if the channel is not answered.

Default: false

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="intercept_unanswered_only=true"/>
&lt;action application="intercept" data="myUUID"/>

  
#### [session_in_hangup_hook](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#session_in_hangup_hook) 

Allows channel variables to be accessible in the api\_hangup\_hook that gets executed for the channel.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="session_in_hangup_hook=true"/>

  
See [Lua#Special\_Case:\_env\_object](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Lua#Special%5FCase:%5Fenv%5Fobject "Lua") for an example of how to use this.

  
### Caller ID Related

#### [caller_id_name](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fcaller%5Fid%5Fname "Variable caller id name") 

The caller id name set by the inbound call, not a real variable. Practically it is read only.

  
#### [caller_id_number](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fcaller%5Fid%5Fnumber "Variable caller id number") 

The caller id phone number set by the inbound call, not a real variable. Practically it is read only. From sofia.c, the values used (in precedence) are the user parts from: P-Preferred-Identity, P-Asserted-Identity, Remote-Party-ID, and the From header.

  
#### [effective_caller_id_name](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Feffective%5Fcaller%5Fid%5Fname "Variable effective caller id name") 

Sets the effective callerid name. This is automatically exported to the B-leg; however, it is not valid in an origination string. In other words, set this before calling bridge, otherwise use [origination\_caller\_id\_name](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Forigination%5Fcaller%5Fid%5Fname "Variable origination caller id name")

[ ![Informational Tip](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/b/b3/Info.png/64px-Info.png) ](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/File:Info.png "Informational Tip")

---

**For Snom 370/820 users:**

If you want to display LEG A's name (if available) as soon as LEG B (here the local Snom) rings, you have to set origination\_caller\_id\_name or effective\_caller\_id\_name as described. Otherwise, in LEG B's display, you will see LEG A's number during ringing and switching to LEG A's name after picking up the call by LEG B. To remove it set it to "\_undef\_".

---
  
  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_name=Bob Smith"/>

  
#### [effective_caller_id_number](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Feffective%5Fcaller%5Fid%5Fnumber "Variable effective caller id number") 

Sets the effective callerid number. This is automatically exported to the B-leg; however, it is not valid in an origination string. In other words, set this before calling bridge, otherwise use [origination\_caller\_id\_number](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Forigination%5Fcaller%5Fid%5Fnumber "Variable origination caller id number")

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=9185551212"/>

  
#### [sip_cid_type](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fsip%5Fcid%5Ftype "Variable sip cid type") 

* Modify how the Caller ID will show up in SIP header of the outbound leg.

**Examples:**

Send no extra caller id info (Caller ID will be in the SIP From):

{sip_cid_type=none}sofia/default/user@example.com

_Note: for gateways (rather than sip calls on a profile), this will not work. You need [caller-id-in-from=true](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") in the gateway settings._

Send Remote-Party-ID (default)

{sip_cid_type=rpid}sofia/default/user@example.com

Send P-Asserted-Identity

{sip_cid_type=pid}sofia/default/user@example.com

_**Note**: you must set privacy flag, otherwise will be inserted P-Preferred-Identity instead of P-Asserted-Identity_

Send RPID with chosen content and privacy flags (+ delimited, none to clear all flags)

{sip_cid_type=rpid,origination_caller_id_name=test,origination_caller_id_number=1234,origination_privacy=screen+hide_name+hide_number}sofia/default/user@example.com

Also the privacy app on the inbound leg controls the remaining contents of the RPID and Privacy headers.

Send Remote-Party-ID with chosen content

{sip_cid_type=rpid,origination_caller_id_name=test,origination_caller_id_number=1234}sofia/default/user@example.com

#### [effective_sip_cid_in_1xx](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fsip%5Fcid%5Fin%5F1xx "Variable sip cid in 1xx") 

Prevents FreeSWITCH when it receives 183 from leg-B to automatically insert RPID before sending 183 to leg-A.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="sip_cid_in_1xx=false"/>

  
### Callee ID Related

#### initial_callee_id_name

Sets the callee id name during the 183\. This allows the phone to see the name of the called party prior to the phone being answered.

An example of setting this to the caller id name of the number being dialed:

&lt;action application="set" data="initial_callee_id_name='${user_data(${dialed_extension}@${domain_name} var effective_caller_id_name)}'"/>

#### origination_callee_id_name

Set on the inbound leg to control what caller ID name appears in the caller phone's display. Also see [ignore\_diplay\_updates](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/index.php?title=Ignore%5Fdiplay%5Fupdates&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ignore diplay updates (page does not exist)") which affect the processing of these variables.

  
Usage:

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{origination_callee_id_name=Reginald}sofia/gateway/provider/&lt;Reginald's cellphone number>" />

If you find using set doesn't work, try using export instead.

#### origination_callee_id_number

Set on the inbound leg to control what caller ID number appears in the caller phone's display. Also see [ignore\_diplay\_updates](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/index.php?title=Ignore%5Fdiplay%5Fupdates&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ignore diplay updates (page does not exist)") which affect the processing of these variables.

  
Usage:

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{origination_callee_id_name=Reginald,origination_callee_id_number=2332}sofia/gateway/provider/&lt;Reginald's cellphone number>" />

### Call Recording Related

These variables all relate to call recording. See also [Misc.\_Dialplan\_Tools\_record\_session](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Frecord%5Fsession "Misc. Dialplan Tools record session")

#### Audio File Metadata

##### RECORD_TITLE

##### RECORD_COPYRIGHT

##### RECORD_SOFTWARE

##### RECORD_ARTIST

##### RECORD_COMMENT

##### RECORD_DATE

##### RECORD_STEREO

#### [record_fill_cng](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Frecord%5Ffill%5Fcng "Variable record fill cng") 

Description need please.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="record_fill_cng=1200"/>

  
#### [RECORD_HANGUP_ON_ERROR](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5FRECORD%5FHANGUP%5FON%5FERROR "Variable RECORD HANGUP ON ERROR") 

When set to _true_ this channel variable will cause the call to hangup if there is an error when trying to record the call. This is not a common feature, however in cases where a call MUST be recorded it makes it impossible to have calls that are not recorded. (Useful in some business scenarios.)

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="RECORD_HANGUP_ON_ERROR=true"/>

  
#### [RECORD_DISCARDED](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5FRECORD%5FDISCARDED "Variable RECORD DISCARDED") 

If a recording gets dropped or discarded then this channel variable is set to true. Useful for diagnostics.

**Usage:**

N/A

  
#### record_post_process_exec_api

and

#### record_post_process_exec_app

These two variables allow the postprocessing of recorded audio. The reason this is required is if the A leg hangs up first in a call, the dialplan stops being processed, and then you aren't able to take action on the file that was recorded. These variables take the form of:

&lt;action application="set" data="record_post_process_exec_api=some_api_app:api_app args" />

Example usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="record_post_process_exec_api=api_here:api_arg1 api_arg2 api_arg3" />

#### [record_restart_limit_on_dtmf](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Frecord%5Frestart%5Flimit%5Fon%5Fdtmf "Variable record restart limit on dtmf") 

[Record restart limit on dtmf](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/index.php?title=Record%5Frestart%5Flimit%5Fon%5Fdtmf&action=edit&redlink=1 "Record restart limit on dtmf (page does not exist)")

#### [record_sample_rate](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Frecord%5Fsample%5Frate "Variable record sample rate") 

Specify the sampling rate of the recorded file.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="record_sample_rate=8000"/>

  
#### [record_waste_resources](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Frecord%5Fwaste%5Fresources "Variable record waste resources") 

By default record doesn't send RTP packets. This is generally acceptable, but for longer recordings or depending on the RTP timer of your gateway, your channel may hangup with cause MEDIA\_TIMEOUT. Setting this variable will 'waste' bandwidth by sending RTP even during recording. The value can be true/false/&lt;desired silence factor>. By default the silence factor is 1400 if you set record\_waste\_resources=true.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="record_waste_resources=true"/>

  
####  recording_follow_transfer 

Set to true if you want recording to continue after a transfer.

#### Example

&lt;action application="set" data="recording_follow_transfer=true"/>

### Codec Related

#### [absolute_codec_string](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#absolute_codec_string) 

Sets the absolute codec string to use (nothing will be appended).

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="absolute_codec_string=PCMU,GSM"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>

  
#### [codec_string](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#absolute_codec_string) 

Sets the base codec string to use.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="codec_string=PCMU,GSM"/>

  
#### [inherit_codec](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#inherit_codec) 

If late negotiation is on, and you set inherit\_codec=true on the A leg, the negotiated codec of the B leg will be forced onto the A leg.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="inherit_codec=true"/>

#### [media_mix_inbound_outbound_codecs](https://freeswitch.org/jira/browse/FS-8321)

Set which list of codecs is offered to the B-leg.

&lt;action application="set" data="media_mix_inbound_outbound_codecs=true"/>

FreeSWITCH used to take the codecs from the inbound A-leg and offer them out to the B-leg mixed with the configured list of outbound codecs. With large lists of codecs this can exceed the MTU of the UDP message and cause call setup failures.

As of FS-8321 the old behavior now requires the variable `media_mix_inbound_outbound_codecs=true` as the new default behavior is to offer the exact same codecs on the outbound B-leg that were offered on the inbound A-leg.

#### [read_codec](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#video_read_codec) 

Read only. The negotiated codec of the inbound call leg.

  
#### [write_codec](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#video_write_codec) 

Read only. The negotiated codec of the outbound call leg.

  
#### [passthru_ptime_mismatch](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#passthru_ptime_mismatch) 

If ptime from leg A and leg B don't match and if mod\_com\_g729 is used, the call would normally use the codec to re-packetize the RTP stream.

With this parameter, mod\_com\_g729 will re-packetize without decoding/encoding, as mod\_g729 would do.

  
**Usage:**

This has to be set in {} before bridging. That will probably not work if set using export before bridging.

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{passthru_ptime_mismatch=true}sofia/gateway/trunk/$1"/>

Note: It may also be set globally in vars.xml.

  
#### [sip_renegotiate_codec_on_reinvite](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_renegotiate_codec_on_reinvite) 

Allow SDP codec change with re-INVITE

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{sip_renegotiate_codec_on_reinvite=true}sofia/gateway/trunk/$1"/>

Note: It may also be set globally in vars.xml or set it in sip profiles (&lt;param name="renegotiate-codec-on-reinvite" value="true"/>)

  
#### [conference_enforce_security](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#conference_enforce_security) 

Allows the conference security to be overridden. This applies in two different scenarios, one for inbound and one for outbound. By default, conference security is always applied to inbound calls and is always skipped for outbound calls. This channel variable allows the behavior to be modified.

  
**Usage:**

Inbound

&lt;action application="set" data="conference_enforce_security=false"/>
&lt;action application="conference" data="3000"/>

Outbound

originate {conference_enforce_security=true}sofia/internal/1001 &conference(3000)

  
#### [suppress_cng](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#suppress_cng) 

Sets a=silenceSupp: off in the sdp to disable silence suppression while making an outbound call.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="suppress_cng=true"/>

  
### IVR related

#### [ivr_menu_terminator](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#ivr_menu_terminator) 

You can set to none or the dtmf chars you want to terminate input.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="ivr_menu_terminator=#"/>

  
#### [detect_speech_result](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#detect_speech_result) 

The result of [play\_and\_detect\_speech](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fplay%5Fand%5Fdetect%5Fspeech "Misc. Dialplan Tools play and detect speech").

**Usage:**

This value is read-only.
  
  
### SIP related variables

#### [rtp_disable_hold](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#rtp_disable_hold) 

When set to true the user may not put the call on hold.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="rtp_disable_hold=true"/>

  
#### [sip_acl_authed_by](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_acl_authed_by) 

Contains the name of the ACL node that authorized this call.

  
**Usage:**

None.

  
#### [sip_acl_token](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_acl_token) 

Contains the ACL auth token for the current call.

  
**Usage:**

N/A

  
#### [sip_copy_multipart](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_copy_multipart) 

FreeSWITCH supports only INVITEs with multipart bodies. FreeSWITCH does not support response messages such as 183 Session Progress or 200 Ok with multipart bodies. Typically SIP bodies only have one MIME part with an SDP using MIME type application/sdp. The SIP spec allows for multiple bodies defined with MIME type multipart/mixed. In this case FreeSWITCH will do it's best to find the MIME part with the SDP and parse that as it normally does. However, you can change FreeSWITCH behavior with multipart bodies and bridge using this variable.

  
**Usage:**

To have FreeSWITCH keep the multiple MIME parts intact when using bridge (default):

&lt;action application="set" data="sip_copy_multipart=true"/>

NOTE: FreeSWITCH will "do the right thing" and attach an application/sdp type generated by FreeSWITCH (per your settings) for the B leg as it normally would. The other non-SDP MIME parts just pass through.

To have FreeSWITCH strip the multiple MIME parts when using bridge:

&lt;action application="set" data="sip_copy_multipart=false"/>

  
####  sip_invite_params

**Usage:**

Example needed! Please contribute one.

  
#### [sip_invite_domain](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_invite_domain) 

Set the from domain in leg (B).

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{sip_invite_domain=${sip_from_host}}sofia/gateway/gw1/$1@domain.org"/>

  
#### sip_from_display

The 'User' element of the SIP From: line

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{sip_from_display=_undef_}user/1001"/>

This will clear the user part of the SIP message sent to the Leg B call.

  
**Implemented By:**

| **Module Name**                                                        | **Source File** | **Last Revised** |

Result:

INVITE sip:555000002;npdi=yes;rn=5555550001@1.2.3.4;user=phone SIP/2.0

  
#### [sip_network_destination](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_network_destination) 

It is intended for use with devices registering behind a NAT where the Request-URI should contain the contact that was bound to the AOR during the registration request while the request itself should be sent to the public IP and port number of the NAT "pinhole". It does not add a Route header field to the request like the ;fs\_path= or the sip\_route\_uri options do.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{sip_network_destination=sip:5551234567@66.243.109.243:10005}sofia/external/5551234567@172.16.110.45:5060"/>

  
#### [sip_auth_username](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_auth_username) 

For mod\_sofia answer auth challenges without defining a full gateway. Used in tandem with [sip\_auth\_password](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fsip%5Fauth%5Fpassword "Variable sip auth password"). Also indicates the SIP username a device successfully registered to FreeSWITCH with.

**Usage:**

#### [auto_answer_destination](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#auto_answer_destination)

In an inbound call, the remote side may send a SIP NOTIFY message with the event type "talk", telling Sofia endpoint to answer the call. In this case, the variable "`auto_answer_destination`" is set to the channel's "`destination_number`", and the call is transferred to the extension "`auto_answer`" within current dialplan and context.

**Usage:**

Example needed! Please contribute one.

**See Also:**

**<https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod%5Fsofia+variables#mod%5Fsofiavariables-auto%5Fanswer%5Fdestination>** 

  
#### [sip_auto_simplify](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_auto_simplify) 

When set, this directs FreeSWITCH to remove itself from the SIP signaling path if it can safely do so.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="sip_auto_simplify=true"/>

  
#### sip_call_id

* optional - Accept/Offer SAVP/AVP with SAVP preferred
* forbidden - More useful for inbound to deny SAVP negotiation
* false - implies forbidden, deprecated
* true - implies mandatory, deprecated
* default - accept SAVP inbound if offered.

list of encryption suites:

* AEAD\_AES\_256\_GCM\_8
* AEAD\_AES\_128\_GCM\_8
* AES\_CM\_256\_HMAC\_SHA1\_80
* AES\_CM\_192\_HMAC\_SHA1\_80

rtp_secure_media=optional:AES_CM_256_HMAC_SHA1_80

rtp_secure_media=true:AES_CM_256_HMAC_SHA1_80 

Additionally you can restrict this list to either inbound or outbound by specifying thus:

rtp_secure_media_inbound=true:AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8,AES_CM_256_HMAC_SHA1_80,AES_CM_256_HMAC_SHA1_32

rtp_secure_media_inbound=mandatory:AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8

rtp_secure_media_outbound=true:AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8

rtp_secure_media_outbound=optional:AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8

  
See also: $CONFDIR/vars.xml

#### rtp_secure_media_suites

Usage: rtp_secure_media_suites=&lt;list of encryption suites>

An alternative, optional variable that specifies a comma-separated list of available encryption suites. If this is specified, then `rtp_secure_media` need only specify the permission flag without the list of suites.

#### [sip_wait_for_aleg_ack](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_wait_for_aleg_ack) 

When you set the variable sip\_wait\_for\_aleg\_ack on the b leg in the {} for the outbound call, this should make the B leg delay sending the ACK until it sees that the A leg has recv'd an ack.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{sip_wait_for_aleg_ack=true}sofia/internal/foo@bar.com"/>

  
#### [timer_name](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#timer_name) 

If set will make playback and speak use a timer to clock the audio instead of the read.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="timer_name=soft"/>

  
#### [ignore_display_updates](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#ignore_display_updates) 

  
Tells freeswitch not to send display UPDATEs to the leg of the call. (update\_display)

  
**Usage:** From dialplan/default.xml:

  
To set on A-Leg

  
&lt;action application="set"  data="ignore_display_updates=true"/>

  
To set on B-Leg

  
&lt;action application="bridge" data="{ignore_display_updates=true}sofia/gateway/provider/18005551212"/>

  
**deny\_refer\_requests**

If this variable is set to true on either leg of a bridged SIP call, and the other end sends a REFER request, this will be denied by FreeSWITCH.

### SDP Manipulation

When set, these variable change the SDP headers. (not for the faint of heart)

#### rtp_append_audio_sdp

This may be used to append audio parameters to the SDP sent to B-leg.

It should/must be set before bridging.

Usage:

&lt;action application="export" data="rtp\_append\_audio\_sdp=a=fmtp:18 annexb=no"/>

#### [sdp_m\_per_ptime](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sdp_m_per_ptime) 

Adds a new m= line for each distinct ptime in codec list.

When this variable is not set:

* When mixing codecs with various ptime in a codec list, they will now be allowed to co-exist in the sdp but it will send no ptime attr. This means the ptime preferences on the offer will be ignored when mixing codecs with various ptimes. When receiving a codec list with no ptime attr, the ptime will be chosen from local preference instead of assuming 20ms. This means if offer contains PCMU with no ptime and FS has PCMU@40i
* Dynamic payloads will now start at 98 and increment per additional dynamic codec per call. So now you can add CELT@32000h,CELT@48000h and each one will be auto-assigned a dynamic payload type.

Is now implied to be true, if you don't like this set it to false but its going to be undefined behaviour. This basically means if you call in with ptime 30 then you have a bunch of ptime 20 codecs in your outbound list that there will be one m= line with 30 and the original inbound codec and more m= lines for each discinct ptime in your list. This is, of course, will depend on disable\_trancoding or absolute\_codec\_string as well

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="sdp_m_per_ptime=true"/>

  
#### [switch_r\_sdp](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#switch_r_sdp) 

Read only. This variable holds the remote SDP for the current leg/channel.

  
**Usage:**

Rewriting SDP:

&lt;action application="set">&lt;![CDATA[switch_r_sdp=(sdp here)
]]>
&lt;/action>

**note**: Don't add a carriage return after "set"> or you'll end up writing a variable with a different name, leaving switch\_r\_sdp with the same value.

  
#### switch_l\_sdp

* (Local SDP)
* Although this variable is defined in switch\_types.h it is not used anywhere in the FreeSwitch code. (It should be removed for the source and from this page.)

#### [switch_m\_sdp](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#switch_m_sdp) 

The B-leg remote SDP.

  
**Usage:**

* Used to store the remote SDP used by the other leg/channel of a call. (In the A-leg that will be the remote SDP of the B-leg.)
* This variable is set, but never used, by FreeSWITCH. ("read-only")

  
#### [sip_ignore_183nosdp](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_ignore_183nosdp)

Ignoring 183 w/o SDP. This option is not for normal basic call flow.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="sip_ignore_183nosdp=true"/>

#### [verbose_sdp](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#verbose_sdp) 

The RFCs require an rtpmap for IANA dynamic payload types. An rtpmap with codec name and payload type is not required for well known static payloads - (PCMU, PCMA, G729, etc).

By default FreeSWITCH sets verbose\_sdp=false which doesn't include an rtpmap for static payload types. If your equipment doesn't support this (shame on them) set verbose\_sdp=true which will include rtpmaps for any static payload types (previous default behavior).

#### [sip_local_sdp_str](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_local_sdp_str) 

Description goes here

  
**Usage:**

Example needed.

  
#### [sip_recovery_break_rfc](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_recovery_break_rfc) 

To NOT reverse the from and to on UAS Re-INVITEs. This breaks RFC.

  
**Usage:**

Examples needed!!!

Note: This variable can be set globally or per channel.

  
#### [sip_mirror_remote_audio_codec_payload](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_mirror_remote_audio_codec_payload) 

To tell sip to break the rfc and expect the codec payload the other side replies with rather than the one it offered which is the correct behavior.

  
**Usage:**

Examples needed!!!

Note: This variable can be set globally or per channel.

  
#### [sip_enable_soa](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sip_enable_soa) 

For per call basis which can be set to false to disable SIP SOA from sofia and most likely result in untouched exchange of SDP.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="bypass_media=true"/>
&lt;action application="export" data="sip_enable_soa=false"/>

  
#### [sdp_secure_savp_only](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#sdp_secure_savp_only) 

When rtp\_secure\_media=true FreeSWITCH will offer both AVP and SAVP in the SDP. Setting sdp\_secure\_savp\_only=true (in addition to rtp\_secure\_media=true) will cause FreeSWITCH to offer only SAVP in the SDP.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="export" data="sdp_secure_savp_only=true"/>

  
### FIFO related variables

#### [fifo_bridged](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_bridged) 

Description goes here

  
**Usage:**

Example needed

  
#### [fifo_caller_consumer_import](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_caller_consumer_import) 

Import list of variables from the caller to the consumer.

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="fifo_caller_consumer_import=var1,var2"/>

  
#### [fifo_consumer_caller_import](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_consumer_caller_import) 

Import list of variables from the consumer to the caller

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="fifo_consumer_caller_import=var1,var2"/>

  
#### [fifo_manual_bridged](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_manual_bridged) 

Description goes here

  
**Usage:**

Example needed

  
#### [fifo_position](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_position) 

Description goes here

  
**Usage:**

Example needed

  
#### [fifo_role](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#fifo_role) 

For reporting purposes, i.e. in the CDRs, the variable will contain "consumer" or "caller" depending upon the call leg.

  
**Usage:**

None

  
#### [transfer_after_bridge](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#transfer_after_bridge) 

This variable can control what happens when a call is hang up. This can be used in conjunction with [mod\_fifo](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Ffifo "Mod fifo") to control the "agent", possibly sending them back to an agent queue. This is checked after [park\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fpark%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable park after bridge") and before [hangup\_after\_bridge](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fhangup%5Fafter%5Fbridge "Variable hangup after bridge").

Note: Variable gets cleaned after bridge is destroyed and leg is transferred to the specified dialplan.

**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="transfer_after_bridge=1000"/>

or,

&lt;action application="set" data="transfer_after_bridge=1000:XML:default"/>

(Note the : separator)

  
### Playback related variables

#### playback_terminators

playback_terminators=123456789*0# | any | none

Allows you to set which DTMF tones, if pressed during the playback of a file or during play\_and\_detect\_speech, will terminate playback. The default terminator is \* (star). Digits not specified as terminators will be collected, but not interrupt playback.

none - undefines the terminator digit, meaning no DTMF tone will be to interrupt playback

any - any DTMF will interrupt playback

Modifiers:

\+ (plus) - includes the following terminator digit along with the other DTMF digits in the returned string

x (letter ex) - includes the following terminator digit in the returned string and also returns SWITCH\_STATUS\_RESTART

This variable applies not only to playback of audio files, but also to the record, tone\_stream, and say() applications as well.

Examples:

 &lt;action application="set" data="playback_terminators=#*"/>

Either \* (star) or # (bar/pound/square) will interrupt the subsequent playback, tone_stream, or say operation.

 &lt;action application="set" data="playback_terminators=*+9"/>

If DTMF 9 is dialed during playback, it will interrupt playback and return the digit 9 along with any other dialed digits; if \* is dialed it will ontly interrupt playback without being included in the DTMF string returned.

#### sound_prefix

Directory prefix where the sounds lives.

#### playback_terminator_used

Contains the digit that the caller used to terminate a playback. Is undef when a new playback is called.

#### playback_ms

Contains the number of milliseconds of the length of the audio file just played back. There is also a variable playback\_seconds which stores the length in whole seconds.

#### playback_samples

Contains the number of samples in the audio file just played back.

#### playback_last_offset_pos

Contains the file offset of the file that just played back. This can be used to resume playback at that position at a later time.

#### playback_sleep_val

How long to pause after a file is played. Default is 250 milliseconds.

To play a list of short files one right after the other, with no pause in between:

 &lt;action application="set" data="playback_sleep_val=0"/>

#### playback_delimiter

When set allows playback of multiple files in sequence, by separating them with the delimiter.

For example, setting playback\_delimiter to the following:

 &lt;action application="set" data="playback_delimiter=&"/>

Permits the streaming of files foo.wav and bar.wav one right after the other:

 &lt;action application="playback" data="foo.wav&bar.wav"/>

#### sleep_eat_digits

When set to true, the sleep application will consume DTMFs which will, for example, prevent a caller from exiting out of an IVR. The default behavior is not to eat DTMF digits. NOTE: this is a change in default behavior as the [sleep](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fsleep "Misc. Dialplan Tools sleep") application previously ate DTMFs without exception. Be sure to set **sleep\_eat\_digits** to _true_ in order to preserve the previous behavior.

 &lt;action application="set" data="sleep_eat_digits=true"/>

This variable was added in SVN rev 14102.

#### playback_timeout_sec

Set timeout for playback. This is very useful if you want to play short excerpts of a file that could be very long.

 &lt;action application="set" data="playback_timeout_sec=10"/>

### Originate related variables

#### [execute_on_originate](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#execute_on_originate) 

Executes code on successful origination. Use the '&lt;app> &lt;arg>' format to execute in the origination thread or use '&lt;app>::&lt;arg>' to execute asynchronously.

Successful origination means the remote server responds, NOT when the call is actually answered.

**Usage:**

originate {ignore_early_media=true,execute_on_originate='cng_plc'}sofia/gateway/foo/123456789 9664

originate {ignore_early_media=true,execute_on_originate='my_app::my_arg'}sofia/gateway/foo/123456789 9664

  
#### leg_delay_start

Specifies a wait time in seconds before each leg is called in a forked dial scenario. Can be used in per-leg \[\], but not in global {} for the dialstring.  
Usage:

&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/profile/dest1,[leg_delay_start=10]sofia/profile/dest2,[leg_delay_start=15]sofia/profile/dest3"/>

#### originate_disposition

This is the originate disposition or hangup cause that is returned. (LEG B)

The value is updated after every bridge attempt, if the bridge is not successful.

#### originate_retries

Number of retries before giving up on originating a call (default is 0).

#### originate_retry_sleep_ms

This will set how long FreeSWITCH is going to wait between sending invite messages to the receiving gateway.

&lt;action application="set" data="originate_retry_sleep_ms=500"/>

Using the value of 500 FreeSWITCH will wait 500ms between sending invite messages to the called gateway.

#### originate_timeout

Determines how long FreeSWITCH is going to wait for a response from the invite message sent to the gateway.

&lt;action application="set" data="originate_timeout=2"/>

This is very useful if you are using multiple gateways within your dial plan.. so if your dial string is:

&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/default/$1@192.168.1.4|sofia/default/$1@192.168.1.5"/>

In this example FreeSWITCH will wait 2 seconds for the 192.168.1.4 to respond to the invite message before trying the next gateway.

#### [originating_leg_uuid](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#originating_leg_uuid) 

Shows the uuid of the originating leg on an outbound channel

**Usage:**

In A-leg CDR:

&lt;uuid>cb5f5b90-75a0-11e0-873b-d1cba9e0f1b8&lt;/uuid>
&lt;call_uuid>cb5f5b90-75a0-11e0-873b-d1cba9e0f1b8&lt;/call_uuid>

In B-leg CDR:

&lt;uuid>cb8633aa-75a0-11e0-873d-d1cba9e0f1b8&lt;/uuid>
&lt;call_uuid>cb5f5b90-75a0-11e0-873b-d1cba9e0f1b8&lt;/call_uuid>
&lt;originating_leg_uuid>cb5f5b90-75a0-11e0-873b-d1cba9e0f1b8&lt;/originating_leg_uuid>

Note that the leg uuid's are different. The call\_uuid matches the two legs together, but the originating\_leg\_uuid can do so as well.

  
#### [origination_channel_name](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#origination_channel_name) 

Set this in the {} when doing an originate to create a custom channel name

**Usage:**

originate {origination_channel_name='this_is_my_channel_name'}loopback/9664 9195

  
#### origination_caller_id_name

Sets the origination callerid name (LEG A).

If you want to set the Caller ID on an origination call you should add this inside the {} brackets before the dialstring.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="origination_caller_id_name=Uncle Sam"/>

#### origination_caller_id_number

Sets the origination callerid number. (LEG A)

If you want to set the Caller ID on an origination call you should add this inside the {} brackets before the dialstring.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="origination_caller_id_number=9185551212"/>

But, if you want to relay the Caller ID Number of an incoming PSTN call via FXO gateway, comment out this variable.

#### origination_cancel_key

_Implemented in revision 14650_ Used with attended transfer function. Allows you to set a DTMF key that will cancel the att\_xfer and re-connect to the call on hold.

It'll also cancel a bridge that hasn't been bridged as yet (and thus can't be terminated with a bridge\_terminate\_key)

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="origination_cancel_key=#"/>

#### origination_privacy

Sets privacy profile for caller. Options are "screen", "hide\_name", "hide\_number".

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="origination_privacy=hide_name"/>

#### origination_uuid

You can specify the uuid of an originated call using origination\_uuid. This way you can hang up the call before it is answered, since you know the uuid. Just remember you need to use the create\_uuid command to generate the uuid as 2 calls with the same uuid == bad!

originate [origination_uuid=....]sofia/&lt;profile>/&lt;extension>

Bridge also uses the origination syntax so you can also pre-allocate the UUID for the new channel resulting from a bridge by using the {}/\[\] syntax and specifying origination\_uuid there, too.

#### originator

Holds the UUID of the channel that originated the call. It's used to notify a parent channel that the state of its child has changed, hence interrupting any blocking reads on the parent. It's automatically set and read by FreeSWITCH internals. Usually, the user won't want to set it.

#### originator_codec

Sets the codec for calls originated from LEG A (setting the codec for LEG B)

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="originator_codec=PCMU"/>

### RTP/media related variables

#### bypass_media

When set, the media (RTP) from the originating endpoint is sent directly to the destination endpoint and vice versa. The signaling (SIP) for both endpoints still goes through FreeSWITCH, but the media is point-to-point.

&lt;action application="set" data="bypass_media=true"/>

See also: [Bypass Media Overview](../../Codecs-and-Media/Bypass-Media-Overview/index.mdx#faq)

#### bypass_media_after_bridge

Same as bypass\_media but will handle media for a call until it has reached the answered state (and has processed a few RTP frames.) At this point FreeSWITCH will use a ReInvite to take itself out of the media path. This helps reduce audio latency and take some load off FreeSWITCH. Especially useful for UACs behind Coned NAT as it gives RTP Auto-Adjust enough time to determine the correct ports to avoid one-way audio.

#### bypass_keep_codec

By doing export bypass\_keep\_codec=true to force re-invite with the same codec it was using previously.

#### proxy_media

Proxy Media mode puts Freeswitch in a "transparent proxy mode" for the RTP streams. The RTP streams still pass through freeswitch (unlike bypass media mode), however it is lighter on the CPU because freeswitch never even parses the packets or processes them in any way, it simply forwards them onwards.

Note: [Late negotiation](../../Codecs-and-Media/Codec-Negotiation_2883752.mdx#about) (&lt;param name="inbound-late-negotiation" value="true"/> ) must be enabled in sip profile for this to work in the dialplan

 &lt;action application="set" data="proxy_media=true"/>

See also: [Proxy Media](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Proxy%5FMedia "Proxy Media")

#### rtp_autoflush

When set to true (default if not present), it will skip timer waits when the socket already has data on read. When set to false, it will always sleep one timer interval. When a packet is too late with this setting, it would be saved for next time in the udp stack and we would place a filler packet into the core to keep it moving that is flagged as CNG so you know there is no audio in it. If you have it set to false, you end up with delay if the other side is sending the audio at a different speed (can be tiny difference but it would build up).

It is worth it to set to true if you have crappy network conditions where you are hearing hiccups it's related to jitter. Sometimes you have the other side sending audio too fast, then this option set to false will smooth it out but if you have it set to false in jitter conditions it tricks it into moving too fast.

#### rtp_autoflush_during_bridge

The same as rpt\_autoflush, but is set during the bridge.

#### disable_rtp_auto_adjust

Disable rtp auto adjust if it not behaves as you expected.

It stops the switch from rewriting the RTP destination based on the source

When RTP Auto-Adjust is ON FreeSWITCH will change the destination RTP address to match the source of the incoming packets, this doesn't work if the other end is really wanting to send and receive on a different addr.

Usage:

Add {disable_rtp_auto_adjust=true} in your dial string.

#### progress_timeout

This is the maximum time we will wait before we get media (whether its early media, ringing or answer) e.g. maximum PDD before abandoning the route -- the time from Sending the INVITE to receiving the first ringing response for example: a SIP/2.0 180 Ringing or 183.

Typical fixed lines have a PDD of under 3 seconds, and mobiles of under 8 seconds.

[Avi Marcus](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/User:Avi%5FMarcus "User:Avi Marcus"): I set my progress\_timeout to 13 seconds to accommodate for slow-setup mobile connections, however, it can probably be shorter.

Two scenarios:

1. If a carrier is having issues with their platform, _all_ calls might timeout.
2. If it's not a carrier issue -- if a single carrier timed out at 13 seconds and the user actually waited, the call rarely connected via any other carrier (although they all expired at 13 seconds).

  
Usage

 &lt;action application="set" data="progress_timeout=20"/>

See also [Early Media](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Early%5FMedia "Early Media")

#### bridge_answer_timeout

* Introduced in build 15057

Timeout in seconds how long to tolerate a bridge that is in early media without being answered (can be set on either leg)

Usage

 &lt;action application="set" data="bridge_answer_timeout=20"

See also [Early Media](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Early%5FMedia "Early Media")

#### ignore_early_media

Controls if the call returns on early media or not. Default is false.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="ignore_early_media=true"/>

You may also specify a value for ignore\_early\_media in the argument to the bridge application, using the { } syntax. (ignore\_early\_media may not be specified on a per-leg basis, using the \[ \] syntax, as it specifically is a global variable to the originate session.)

&lt;action application="bridge" data="{ignore_early_media=true}sofia/test-int/1001@somebox,sofia/test-int/1000@somehost"/>

Setting the value to "ring\_ready" will work the same as ignore\_early\_media=true but also send a SIP 180 to the inbound leg when the first SIP 183 is caught.

 &lt;action application="set" data="ignore_early_media=ring_ready"/>

See also [Early Media](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Early%5FMedia "Early Media")

#### ringback

This addition lets you set artificial ringback on a channel that is waiting for an originated call to be answered. This will specify the audio to play to the A leg on unanswered aka (early media) calls.

The syntax is:

```xml
<action application="set" data="ringback=[data]"/>
```

Where data is either the full path (important! must be full path!) to an audio file or [teletone generation markup language](../../Modules/mod-dptools/gentones/TGML_6586573.mdx#lua).

You may also combine this with the ring\_ready application. In this case the caller hears the normal ringback tone for a fraction of a second, then he hears the defined ringback media.

Note: Since r15025 local ringback tone is generated only when there is no early media. To force local ringback despite of early media use the [ignore\_early\_media](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fignore%5Fearly%5Fmedia "Variable ignore early media") channel variable.

The following example uses the US ring tone defined in \~/vars.xml:

```xml
<action application="set" data="ringback=${fr-ring}"/>
```

Example #2:

```xml
<action application="set" data="ringback=%(2000,4000,440.0,480.0)"/>
```

Example #3:

You can send ringback after the call is answered.

```py
def handler(uuid):
    session = PySession(uuid)
    session.answer()
    session.speak("Hello, connecting your call to the first available agent")
    session.execute("set","call_timeout=30")
    session.execute("set","continue_on_fail=true")
    session.execute("set","hangup_after_bridge=true")
    session.execute("set","ringback=%(2000,4000,440.0,480.0)")
    session.execute("bridge","sofia/foo/bar@test.com,sofia/foo/baz@test2.com:5070")
    session.speak("doh!")
```

Ringback will not be sent unless the variable is set \*and\* there's a ringing indication from the party that is being called.

If you want to use fake ringback via the ringback variable and you want it to happen instantly, you can also do:

```xml
<action application="set" data="instant_ringback=true"/> 
```

And FS will send ringback without waiting for a ringing indication. Note that this may cause undesirable effects, like ringing for 3 seconds that turns into a busy signal.

#### instant_ringback

When set, ringback will not wait for indication before sending ringback tone to calling party

Usage:

```xml
<action application="set" data="instant_ringback=true"/>
```

#### transfer_ringback

This is the sound that will play if a call has already been answered, and it is then transferred to another endpoint.

Usage:

```xml
<action application="set" data="transfer_ringback=[data]"/>
```

Where data is either the full path to an audio file or [teletone generation markup language](../../Modules/mod-dptools/gentones/TGML_6586573.mdx#lua).

The following example uses the French ringtone defined in \~/vars.xml:

```xml
<action application="set" data="transfer_ringback=${fr-ring}"/>
```

#### rtp_disable_hold

This is the channel variable for disable-hold.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="rtp_disable_hold=true"/>

#### rtp_negotiate_near_match

Setting this to true will cause FreeSWITCH to consider codec PTIME on inbound codec negotiation as well. If you receive a call with PCMU@30i and only have PCMU@20i on the list, it will prefer anything else that matches codec and ptime by default. This changes behavior and matches PCMU@30i despite the PTIME mismatch. This is only valid if you have other matching codecs on the endpoints lists, of course.

Usage:

&lt;action application="set" data="rtp_negotiate_near_match=true"/>

### RTCP Related

#### [rtcp_packet_count](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#rtcp_packet_count) 

Contains number of RTCP packets collected during the call.

**Usage:**

N/A

  
#### [rtcp_octet_count](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#rtcp_octet_count) 

Contains number of RTCP octets collected during the call.

**Usage:**

N/A

#### rtcp_audio_interval_msec

Channel variable to set the interval in msec between each RTCP SR paquet.   
WARNING: setting the rtp\_timer\_name to none will create all sorts of undesired side effects with RTCP ( paquets not sent, RTCP autoadjust failing, etc... ).

#### rtcp_mux

Channel variable to force rtcp-mux to be used on the outgoing INVITE.

#### rtp_assume_rtcp

Channel variable to force freeswitch to assume rtcp is at rtp port + 1 all the time.

  
### Camp-on related variables

Camping is used when bridging a call. It will basically park (aka camp) your channel to music on hold while it attempts to bridge the call.

#### [campon](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#campon) 

Controls whether camping is enabled or not.

Default: false

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="campon=true"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>

  
#### [campon_retries](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#campon_retries) 

Controls how many times the bridge will be retried while camping.

Default: 100

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="campon=true"/>
&lt;action application="set" data="campon_retries=13"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>

  
#### [campon_timeout](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#campon_timeout) 

This variable controls how long to attempt each bridge before timing out. It works exactly like [call\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fcall%5Ftimeout "Variable call timeout") but only applies to camping.

Default: 10

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="campon=true"/>
&lt;action application="set" data="campon_timeout=20"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>

  
#### [campon_sleep](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#campon_sleep) 

Controls how long to wait before starting a retry.

Default: 10

  
**Usage:**

&lt;action application="set" data="campon=true"/>
&lt;action application="set" data="campon_sleep=30"/>
&lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>

  
#### [campon_fallback_exten](./x__Variables_6587314.mdx#campon_fallback_exten) 

Controls camping during bridge app (testing needed)

  
**Usage:**

### Answer confirmation variables

#### group_confirm_file

This variable is used together with group\_confirm\_key. In group\_confirm\_file, you specify the wav file you want to play when the called party picks up the call. In the group\_confirm\_key variable, you define the DTMF that the called party should send to FS to bridge the call. If a wrong DTMF or no DTMF is sent, the called won't be bridged and the wav file will be repeated.

&lt;action application="set" data="group_confirm_file=/usr/local/freeswitch/sounds/take_call_question.wav" />
&lt;action application="set" data="group_confirm_key=1" />

Through this is the standard usage of these variables (group\_confirm\_key and group\_confirm\_file), they can be used in a more flexible manner. Please see [Freeswitch\_IVR\_Originate#Answer\_confirmation](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Freeswitch%5FIVR%5FOriginate#Answer%5Fconfirmation "Freeswitch IVR Originate").

#### group_confirm_key

see group\_confirm\_file

#### group_confirm_cancel_timeout

If set, cancels leg\_timeout after the call is answered. originate\_timeout still remains active.

More detail:

When using group confirm, a call passes through three phases:

1. Call is ringing
2. Call is answered, waiting to be confirmed
3. Call is confirmed and bridged

Normally, a timeout on the leg will apply to phases 1 and 2.

However, if you do

 &lt;action application="set" data="group_confirm_cancel_timeout=1"/>

then the timeout will only apply to phase 1\. So, once the phase 1 is crossed, leg\_timeout counter stops.
