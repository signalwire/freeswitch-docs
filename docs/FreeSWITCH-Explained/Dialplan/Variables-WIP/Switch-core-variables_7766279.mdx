# Switch core variables 

 

## About

This is a list of channel variables defined in FreeSWITCH core.

## Timestamp variables

The following variables are set by FreeSWITCH after the channel is hung up, and contain timestamps for various state changes for a channel.

| State change           | Variable (epoch seconds) | Variable (epoch microseconds) | Variable (Date and time) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| caller profile created | profile\_start\_epoch    | profile\_start\_uepoch        | profile\_start\_stamp    |
| started                | start\_epoch             | start\_uepoch                 | start\_stamp             |
| answered               | answer\_epoch            | answer\_uepoch                | answer\_stamp            |
| bridged                | bridge\_epoch            | bridge\_uepoch                | bridge\_stamp            |
| last\_hold             | last\_hold\_epoch        | last\_hold\_uepoch            | hold\_stamp              |
| resurrected            | resurrect\_epoch         | resurrect\_uepoch             | resurrect\_stamp         |
| progress               | progress\_epoch          | progress\_uepoch              | progress\_stamp          |
| progress\_media        | progress\_media\_epoch   | progress\_media\_uepoch       | progress\_media\_stamp   |
| hungup                 | end\_epoch               | end\_uepoch                   | end\_stamp               |

## Accumulated timers

The following variables display various time-related information after the channel is hung up, in different formats:

| Value                                                     | Variable (seconds)   | Variable (milliseconds) | Variable (microseconds) |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| call duration (from channel creation to hangup)           | duration             | mduration               | uduration               |
| wait (from creation to bridged state)                     | waitsec              | waitmsec                | waitusec                |
| total hold time                                           | hold\_accum\_seconds | hold\_accum\_ms         | hold\_accum\_usec       |
| billing duration (from answered to hungup)                | billsec              | billmsec                | billusec                |
| leg billing duration (from created to hungup)             | flow\_billsec        | flow\_billmsec          | flow\_billusec          |
| answer waiting (from creation to answered)                | answersec            | answermsec              | answerusec              |
| call progress waiting (from creation to progress)         | progresssec          | progressmsec            | progressusec            |
| media progress waiting (from creation to progress\_media) | progress\_mediasec   | progress\_mediamsec     | progress\_mediausec     |

  
## absolute_codec_string

Sets the absolute codec string to use (nothing will be appended).

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="absolute_codec_string=PCMU,GSM"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/myprovider/5551231234"/>
```

**Per-leg Dialstring:**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data=[leg_timeout=60,origination_caller_id_number=918039251,
absolute_codec_string=^^:PCMA:PCMU]sofia/gateway/gateway1/${destination_number}|[leg_timeout=60,
absolute_codec_string=PCMA]sofia/gateway/gateway2/${destination_number}"/>
```

**Global Dialstring:**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{absolute_codec_string=PCMA}sofia/gateway/gateway2/${destination_number}"/>
```

## api_after_bridge

Execute an API command after bridge.

**Usage:**

```xml
<extension name="paging-with-chime">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^7243$">
        <action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app=playback"/>
        <action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_data=/tmp/2_tone_chime.wav"/>
        <action application="set" data="api_after_bridge=luarun post-chime.lua"/>
        <action application="bridge" data="portaudio/auto_answer"/>
    </condition>
</extension>
post-chime.lua:
   api = freesswitch.API();
   api:execute("pa", "play /tmp/2_tone_chime.wav");
```

## api_hangup_hook

Execute an API command on hangup.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="api_hangup_hook=jsrun cleanup.js ${uuid}"/>
```

**See also:**

* session\_in\_hangup\_hook
* api\_reporting\_hook - like api\_hangup\_hook but after reporting state (both honor session\_in\_hangup\_hook)

## api_on_answer

Execute an api (not an application) when the called party answers. To set an application, use [execute\_on\_answer](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fexecute%5Fon%5Fanswer "Variable execute on answer").

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:api_on_answer=uuid_broadcast ${uuid} beep.wav both"/> 
```

Or,

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{api_on_answer='uuid_broadcast ${uuid} beep.wav both'}sofia/gateway/provider/5551231234"/> 
```

## api_on_media

Execute a FreeSWITCH API when the far end sends media, i.e. ringing or 183/SDP.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with nolocal: prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds without ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/> 
```

## api_on_startup

Execute an api (not an application) when the switch starts up.

**Usage:**

```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="api_on_startup=sofia recover"/>
```

## asr_intercept_dtmf

If set to true, DTMF input is interpreted alongside the automatic speech recognition.

## bind_meta_key

Selects the meta key to use with the [mod\_dptools: bind\_meta\_app](../../Modules/mod-dptools/6586418.mdx#about) dialplan application (or any other application that utilizes `switch_ivr_bind_dtmf_meta_session` core function for binding application calls to DTMF input).

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="bind_meta_key=#"/> 
```

## bridge_answer_timeout

Timeout in seconds how long to tolerate a bridge that is in early media without being answered (can be set on either leg). Useful when you want to pass early media from b-leg to a-leg but also use `${call_timeout}`. This will consider the bridge failed if a 200 OK is not received before the `bridge_answer_timeout`.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="bridge_answer_timeout=20"/>
```

## bridge_channel

Upon a successful bridge, FreeSWITCH sets` bridge_channel` variable on both legs to indicate the other leg's channel name.  

## bridge_early_media

By default this is false. Set to true, this makes the bridge use the live audio from the b-leg as ringback to the a-leg. Setting `bridge_early_media=true` means the early media will be buffered.

Consider setting this to true if you are using a loopback channel to execute a bridge to an endpoint which sends back early media and the received early media's audio is degraded. The buffering resulting from setting `bridge_early_media=true` brings with it a higher resource cost (than `bridge_early_media=false`), but may improve the sound quality of the early media.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="bridge_early_media=true"/>
```

## bridge_filter_dtmf

Setting this variable to true will prevent DTMF digits received on this channel when bridged from being sent to the other channel.

**Usage:**

You can set this variable in the dialplan before answering or inline as part of a dialstring.

Example dialplan usage:

```xml
<action application="set" data="bridge_filter_dtmf=true" />
```

Example dialstring usage:

```xml
{bridge_filter_dtmf=true}sofia/default/blah@baz.com
```

## bridge_generate_comfort_noise

Generates comfort noise when bridged session is receiving discontinuous audio frames (silence suppression).

When greater than 0, this variable is set to the divisor of the silence generating function. 400 or 1400 are common values set, but you may experiment with other choices to pick one that sounds best.

When true, FreeSWITCH will pick a default comfort noise value.

When -1, FreeSWITCH will transmit silence without comfort noise.

**Usage:**

Leg A wants a continuous stream of audio, but leg B is using silence suppression:

```xml
<action application="set" data="bridge_generate_comfort_noise=true"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/user/1000"/>
```

Leg A uses silence suppression, but leg B wants a continuous stream of audio:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{bridge_generate_comfort_noise=true}sofia/user/1000"/>
```

## bridge_hangup_cause

This is set to the hangup cause of the last bridged B leg of the call. If you have `continue_on_fail=true` and `hangup_after_bridge=false`, you can do checks on this to see what "really" happened to the call. You can for instance do `execute_extension` after bridge, do a condition check on `${bridge_hangup_cause}` to see if it contains `MEDIA_TIMEOUT` and then trigger a redial of the call or transfer to a cell phone. For a list of hangup causes, see [Hangup Causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about).

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="log" data="1 B-leg hangup cause: ${bridge_hangup_cause}"/>
```

## bridge_pre_execute_aleg_app

Command or API to be executed on the A leg before bridging the two channels.

Note: this is executed AFTER the call is setup but BEFORE the media (audio) is bridged.

## bridge_pre_execute_aleg_data

Arguments to be used with `bridge_pre_execute_aleg_app`.

## bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app

Command or API to be executed on the B leg before bridging the two channels. Useful when originating a call from the event socket, CLI or XML-RPC.

It could for instance be used to do a HTTP GET with a script or `mod_http` to the IP address of a Snom phone to increase the ringer volume if you need to do a wake-up call.

Can also be used to bind a DTMF event to an app on the B leg of a call so that it can survive a transfer.

Note: this is executed AFTER the call is setup, but BEFORE the media (audio) is bridged.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app=bind_meta_app"/>
<action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_data=1 a s att_xfer::sofia/profile/destination"/>
```

## bridge_pre_execute_bleg_data

Arguments to be used with `bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app`.

## bridge_terminate_key

Allows you to bind a key and the bridge will terminate if the dtmf matches

## bridge_to

When a bridge is initiated, this variable is set on both legs to indicate the other leg's channel UUID.

## bridge_uuid

Upon a successful bridge, FreeSWITCH sets` bridge_uuid` variable on both legs to indicate the other leg's channel UUID.

## bypass_media

When set to true, all the media address of the far end of the originating leg will be passed to the far end of the new call leg and vice versa, so the signaling goes through FreeSWITCH, but the media is point-to-point.

**Usage:**

```xml
 <action application="set" data="bypass_media=true"/>
```

## bypass_media_after_bridge

This is useful for bypassing media after bridging has happened.

Verto note

bypass\_media\_after\_bridge is not implemented in Verto.

**Usage:**

```xml
 <action application="set" data="bypass_media_after_bridge=true"/>
```

 It could be useful for an already established channel and doing a later bypass.

```xml
 uuid_setvar <uuid> bypass_media_after_bridge true
 uuid_broadcast <uuid> bridge::<endpoint>
```

## cache_speech_handles

If set to true, the TTS engine handle is cached for subsequent use instead of being re-created again on every use.

## call_timeout

Controls how long (in seconds) to ring the B leg of a call when using the `bridge` application. The timeout is set on the A leg, and applies to any bridges that happen in the channel.

If you need to set a timeout on a call that has no A leg, use [originate\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Foriginate%5Ftimeout "Variable originate timeout")

If you need to set a timeout with enterprise bridging/originate, use [originate\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Foriginate%5Ftimeout "Variable originate timeout")

If you need to set the timeout on a per leg basis (i.e., a different timeout for each destination), use the [leg\_timeout](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fleg%5Ftimeout "Variable leg timeout") variable.

Default Value: 60

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="call_timeout=20"/>
```

**Notes:**

If a call timeout is to be specified against a group\_call() list, use the following format:

```xml
 <action application="bridge" data="{originate_timeout=24}${group_call(sales@$${domain})}"/>
```

Beware that if you are not using `{ignore_early_media=true}`, `call_timeout` is no longer applicable as soon as early media signal is received.

## caller_id

After the call is hung up, FreeSWITCH sets this variable to reflect the caller ID number or a combination of caller name and the number.

## caller_id_name

The caller id name set by the inbound call, not a real variable. Practically it is read only.

## caller_id_number

The caller id phone number set by the inbound call, not a real variable. Practically it is read only. From sofia.c, the values used (in precedence) are the user parts from: P-Preferred-Identity, P-Asserted-Identity, Remote-Party-ID, and the From header.

## channel_name

This variable is set by various modules and contains a string that non-uniquely describes the channel. It can also be changed by `set_name` dialplan application.

## codec_string

Sets the base codec string to use.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="codec_string=PCMU,GSM"/>
```

## continue_on_fail

Controls what happens when the called party can not be reached (busy/offline). If "true" the dialplan continues to be processed. If "false" the dialplan will stop processing. Can contain the return messages that will continue on fail also.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>
```

or,

```xml
<action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=NORMAL_TEMPORARY_FAILURE,USER_BUSY,NO_ANSWER,NO_ROUTE_DESTINATION"/>
```

or Q.850 cause codes,

```xml
<action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=3,17,18,27"/>
```

## copy_json_cdr

Copies the B leg's JSON CDR into A leg's variable named `b_leg_cdr` as an URL-encoded string. This variable must be set on the B leg, so use `{copy_xml_cdr=true}` in the dialstring or use `export` instead of `set`.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{copy_json_cdr=true} user/${dialed_extension}@${domain_name}"/>
```

**See also:**

* [mod\_json\_cdr](../../Modules/mod_json_cdr_4653124.mdx#output-example-cdrs)

## copy_xml_cdr

Copies the B leg's XML CDR into A leg's variable named `b_leg_cdr` as an URL-encoded string. This variable must be set on the B leg, so use `{copy_xml_cdr=true}` in the dialstring or use `export` instead of `set`.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{copy_xml_cdr=true} user/${dialed_extension}@${domain_name}"/>
```

**See also:**

* [mod\_xml\_cdr](../../Modules/mod_xml_cdr_6587377.mdx#faq)

## current_application

The name of an application that is currently being executed on the channel.

## current_application_data

The arguments of a currently executed application

## current_application_response

Response string returned by the last executed application.

## default_language

Controls the default language the Say Phrase engine will use when no language is explicitly specified in the API call. This permits you to easily support multiple languages by only changing a single variable at call time.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="default_language=fr"/>
```

## destination_number

This variable indicates the call destination string.

## dialed_domain

This variable is set by several commands and applications, such as `bridge` and `originate`, when the call is targeted to a directory user. It contains the domain name that is associated with the user.

## dialed_user

Analogous to `dialed_domain,` ` dialed_user` contains the user name when the call is connected too a directory user.  

## digits_dialed

After the channel is hung up, this variable contains DTMF digits which were dialed during the call, or "none" if no digits were dialed. The variable `digits_dialed_filter` may define a regexp filter that would be applied to the dialed digits.

## digits_dialed_filter

This variable defines a regexp filter that is applied to dialed DTMF digits before they are exposed in` digits_dialed` variable.  

## direction

This variable is set to "inbound" or "outbound", depending on the direction of the call leg.

## disable_app_log

By default, each executed application is stored in the session object, and written into XML CDR or JSON CDR at the end of a call. This variable, if set to "true", disables this behavior.

## rtp_disable_hold

When set to true the user may not put the call on hold.

## disable_rtp_auto_adjust

Disable rtp auto adjust if it not behaves as you expected.

It stops the switch from rewriting the RTP destination based on the source

When RTP Auto-Adjust is ON FreeSWITCH will change the destination RTP address (port?) to match the source of the incoming packets, this doesn't work if the other end is really wanting to send and receive on a different addr (port?).

## DISPLACE_HANGUP_ON_ERROR

When set to "true", this channel variable will cause the call to hangup if there is an error when trying to [uuid\_displace](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fcommands#uuid%5Fdisplace "Mod commands") the call. The default is "false".

## domain_name

In an inbound channel from an authenticated user,` domain_name` and `user_name` are reflecting the domain and the user names from the directory, respectively.  

## drop_dtmf

Set this on an inbound channel before `answer` or on an outbound channel before `bridge` or `originate` in order to prevent DTMF events from being sent to the channel.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="drop_dtmf=true"/>
<action application="answer"/>
```

or,

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:drop_dtmf=true"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/internal/100@1.2.3.4"/>
```

or,

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{drop_dtmf=true}sofia/internal/100@1.2.3.4"/>
```

## drop_dtmf_masking_file

If `drop_dtmf` is set to "true",` drop_dtmf_masking_file` may point to a playback string which will be played instead of DTMF on the other leg.

## drop_dtmf_masking_digits

If `drop_dtmf` is set to "true", `drop_dtmf_masking_digits` may contain a string of digits which will be played instead of each DTMF tone on the other leg.

## dtmf_type

Sets the way DTMF is transmitted into the channel. For inband DTMF, [Misc. Dialplan Tools start\_dtmf](../../Modules/mod-dptools/6587132.mdx#0-about) must be used in the dialplan.

Accepted values: "`rfc2833`", "`info`", "`none`"

## eavesdrop_announce_id, eavesdrop_announce_macro  

In `eavesdrop` application, as well as in other applications that use eavesdrop (`spy`, `three_way`, and some others), if the variable `eavesdrop_announce_id` is defined in the joining channel, the announcement macro is played into the eavesdropped session before the third party joins in. By default, the phrase macro `eavesdrop_announce` is played with the value of `eavesdrop_announce_id` variable as the input argument. The name of the macro can be changed by defining the variable `eavesdrop_announce_macro` in the joining channel.

## eavesdrop_group, eavesdrop_require_group  

In `eavesdrop` application, as well as in other applications that use eavesdrop, if `eavesdrop_require_group` is specified, `eavesdrop` only works with channels that have an `eavesdrop_group` channel variable set to the same name.

## effective_caller_id_name

Sets the effective callerid name. This is automatically exported to the B-leg; however, it is not valid in an origination string. In other words, set this before calling bridge, otherwise use `origination_caller_id_name`

**For Snom 370/820 users:**

If you want to display LEG A's name (if available) as soon as LEG B (here the local Snom) rings, you have to set `origination_caller_id_name` or `effective_caller_id_name` as described. Otherwise, in LEG B's display, you will see LEG A's number during ringing and switching to LEG A's name after picking up the call by LEG B. To remove it set it to "\_undef\_".

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_name=Bob Smith"/>
```

## effective_caller_id_number

Sets the effective callerid number. This is automatically exported to the B-leg; however, it is not valid in an origination string. In other words, set this before calling bridge, otherwise use `origination_caller_id_number`

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=9185551212"/>
```

## enable_file_write_buffering

Enable file buffering when recording a file, defaults to true if not set.

Buffer size defaults to \`SWITCH\_DEFAULT\_FILE\_BUFFER\_LEN\` but can be overridden by putting bytes size instead of true (see below example).

[Related discussion](http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2012-April/082835.html)

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=false"/> 
<action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=true"/> 
<action application="set" data="enable_file_write_buffering=65535"/> 
```

## enable_heartbeat_events, heartbeat_fire_on_set, heartbeat_use_scheduler  

These variables control the firing of `SESSION_HEARTBEAT` events for a given session. 

`enable_heartbeat_events` can have an integer value or "`true`". The integer value defines the frequency of heartbeat events. If set to "true", the frequency is set to 60 seconds.

If `heartbeat_fire_on_set` is set to "`true`", the heartbeat event is fired immediately after answering or after receiving media.. Otherwise, it's scheduled for one period in the future.

If `heartbeat_use_scheduler` is set to "`true`", the heartbeat is forced to use the scheduler rather than the media stream and also make it auto-change between modes when going in and out of the media path in FS core.

## ep_codec_prefer_sdp

If set to true, the B leg prefers the codecs proposed by the A leg 

## ep_codec_string

`ep_codec_string` contains the "endpoint" codec string on the A leg. This codec list includes only the codecs that _both_ the A leg and FreeSWITCH agree upon. This variable is set only when inbound-late-negotiation is enable on the SIP profile.   
NOTE: When there is more than one codec in the list, the order of preference is chosen by FreeSWITCH, not by the A leg

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{absolute_codec_string=${ep_codec_string}}sofia/foo/bar@baz"/>
```

## exec_after_bridge_app, exec_after_bridge_arg  

Execute an application command after the bridge has been terminated. The application is specified by `exec_after_bridge_app`, and `exec_after_bridge_arg` specifies the arguments. By contrast, to execute when the bridge has been established, use **execute\_on\_answer**

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="exec_after_bridge_app=transfer"/>
<action application="set" data="exec_after_bridge_arg=2102"/> 
```

**See also:**

* [exec\_after\_bridge\_arg](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fexec%5Fafter%5Fbridge%5Farg "Variable exec after bridge arg")
* [execute\_on\_answer](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Fexecute%5Fon%5Fanswer "Variable execute on answer")

## execute_on_answer

Execute an application (not an API) when the called party answers. To set an API, use **api\_on\_answer**. **execute\_on\_answer** will also allow for more control when dealing with no answer conditions in cases where you cannot ignore early media.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with nolocal: prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds while manually ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.

  
**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_answer=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/> 
```

or, to wait 30 seconds for an answer while 'manually' ignoring early media

originate `{ignore_early_media=true}sofia/gateway/my_gateway/5551212 885551212`

```xml
<extension name="exe_on_ans">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^88(\d+)$">
    <action application="set" data="execute_on_answer=transfer ANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
    <action application="log" data="INFO Waiting 30 seconds for $1 to answer..."/>
    <action application="sleep" data="30000"/>
    <action application="log" data="INFO Call to $1 was not answered, taking alternative action..."/>
    <action application="transfer" data="UNANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

If you need to set multiple execute\_on\_answers, the following syntax allows multiple applications for a single condition. Example:

```xml
<action application="set" data="execute_on_answer_1=app1 arg"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_answer_2=app2 arg"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_answer_3=app3 arg"/>
```

## execute_on_media

Execute an application when the far end sends media, i.e. ringing or 183/SDP.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with `nolocal:` prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds without ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.  
**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>
```

## execute_on_media_timeout

Execute an application if the far end stops sending media and times out.

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_media_timeout=lua oops_timeout.lua ${uuid}"/>
<action application="set" data="execute_on_media_timeout=transfer HANDLE_MEDIA_TIMEOUT XML default"/>
```

## execute_on_originate

Executes code on successful origination. Use the '`<app> <arg>`' format to execute in the origination thread or use '`<app>::<arg>`' to execute asynchronously.

Successful origination means the remote server responds, NOT when the call is actually answered.

**Usage:**

```xml
originate {ignore_early_media=true,execute_on_originate='cng_plc'}sofia/gateway/foo/123456789 9664

originate {ignore_early_media=true,execute_on_originate='my_app::my_arg'}sofia/gateway/foo/123456789 9664
```

## execute_on_pre_answer

Execute an application (not an API) when the called party "preanswers" - that is, when some form of early media is coming or the far end sends a 180 Ringing.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use export or export with `nolocal:` prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds without ignoring media. In this case we use 'set' and not 'export'.  
**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_pre_answer=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>
```

## execute_on_ring

Execute a command when the called party rings.  
**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="nolocal:execute_on_ring=lua markring ${uuid}"/>
```

## export_vars

export\_vars lists variables to be exported to the other leg upon bridge. Unlike [export](../../Modules/mod_dptools_1970333.mdx#c), it only lists the variables to export without actually setting them. Note: This is useful to transfer information from a-leg (INVITE) to the future b-leg of REFER.

## fail_on_single_reject

This is useful when using the "," AND operator in the DATA field of a bridge. The AND operator notifies a list of destinations, bridging to the first destination that accepts the call. Typically if a destination in the list rejects the call, the bridge will continue to be attempted until either another destination accepts the call, or a timeout occurs.

This variable allows one to terminate the bridging attempt on a single rejection of the call. This means the bridge attempt would fail, and if continue\_on\_fail has not been set, the call is terminated. This variable would be set within a condition before a bridge application. When used in conjunction with the continue\_on\_fail variable, one can perform operations such as rolling over a rejected caller to an answering machine application.

The default setting is FALSE, meaning a single rejection will not terminate the bridging attempt.

It can also be set to a list of [failure causes](../../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about) to stop on, and can be negated to a list of causes not to stop on (i.e. stop on all other failure causes).

**Usage:**

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=true"/>
<action application="bridge" data="sofia/$${profile}/$${kitchen}%$${domain},sofia/$${profile}/$${dining}%$${domain}"/>
<action application="javascript" data="answermachine.js"/>
```
or,

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=USER_BUSY"/>
```

or,

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!NORMAL_CIRCUIT_CONGESTION"/>
```

or to use a list,

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=^^:CALL_REJECTED:NORMAL_CLEARING:USER_BUSY"/>
```

or for negated list,

```xml
<action application="set" data="fail_on_single_reject=!^^:ALLOTTED_TIMEOUT:NETWORK_OUT_OF_ORDER"/>
```
