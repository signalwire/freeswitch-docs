## Usage

There are times when you would like to have a directory username which is very different from the contact information for reaching that user. For instance, maybe you want each device to register with mac-address\_line-number (000e081c4f6a\_1) but they will have a standard npa-nxx number which routes to them (509.123.4567).

There are a couple things that you will need. First the directory:

The key here is the variable `sip-force-user` . Set this to the phone number to which you want to map the user:

**sip-force-user Example**

```xml
<!-- this is in conf/directory/default/ -->
<include>
  <user id="000e081c4f6a_1" mailbox="5091234567">
    <params>
      <param name="password" value="1234"/>
    </params>
    <variables>
      <variable name="user_context" value="default"/>
      <variable name="sip-force-user" value="5091234567"/>
    </variables>
  </user>
</include>
```

Next, match a number and send the call to this user.

You must use `sofia` or `sofia_contact` in the bridge string here, `user` will not work because of `sip-force-user`. Here is an example:

**Contact Mapping XML Example**

```xml
<!-- this is an example extension in conf/dialplan/ -->
<extension name="Call_User">
   <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d+)$">
     <action application="set" data="call_timeout=20"/>
     <action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
     <action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>
     <action application="bridge" data="${sofia_contact($1@$${domain})}"/>
     <action application="answer"/>
     <action application="set" data="vm_exten=$1" />
     <action application="sleep" data="1000"/>
     <action application="voicemail" data="default ${domain_name} $1"/>
   </condition>
</extension>
```

A word of caution: depending on how you route calls here, this will match all numbers and try to send them to `sip-force-users` listed in your directory.
