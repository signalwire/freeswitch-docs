## About

All listings beneath the quote here are considered a **work of fiction** as of 14 May 2008\. Please read it and know that you will have to do your own due diligence to scale FreeSWITCH.

_"Routinely my FreeSWITCH routing servers reach > 400 sessions Per Second (where they are rated limited) and > 4000 concurrent Sessions (where they are also limited) with approx 20% CPU utilization and 30% ram utilization on a Dell 1950 w/ Dual Xeon E5335 2Ghz Quad Core CPUs and 4G of ram" Any SPS and Concurrency limiting is done not to protect my boxes but upstream peers I have had at least 3 occasions where Large Tier 1 / Tier 2 Intel and Domestic US LD Carriers have asked for mercy one called saying "Can you please slow the traffic up, you are melting down my \{CENSORED} SBCs" well the vendors in question that I know for a Fact are Veraz and AcmePacket." - someone in our user base (As we approach our 1.0 release)._

FreeSWITCHâ„¢ has performance, but sometimes performance of one box isn't enough, either because you want fail-over, load-balancing to handle more than one box can allow, or some type of fault tolerance that would not exist with a single box.

There are a variety of methods you may employ to achieve this goal. Here are some to choose from. It is strongly encouraged that you understand the concepts being employed here, as well as why this would fit into your overall system design and do not just pick one at random because someone suggested it worked for them. To maximize performance you need to create a solution that works for your specific environment, what works for one may be totally inappropriate for someone else.
