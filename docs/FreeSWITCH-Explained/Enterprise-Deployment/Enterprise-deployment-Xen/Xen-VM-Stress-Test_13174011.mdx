## Test Conditions

### Hardware

**Box:** Xen VM AMD Opteron Dual Core (2x1.7GHz) 64-bit machine, first (O): 256 MB RAM, then 1,5 GB RAM 

### OS

**OS:** Ubuntu Linux 6.06 dapper x64, 1GB ramfs when needed, **FreeSWITCH Version 1.0.pre3 (7750M)** 

### Tools

**Testing tool:** SIPp v3.0-TLS-PCAP, version svn424 ([http://sipp.sourceforge.net/](http://sipp.sourceforge.net/)) with slightly modified\* standard uas & uac\_pcap scenerios on another box with 1 min. pre-recorded pcap streams

* the only modification was the path of the pcap file

## Experience

* With high CPS and concurrent calls there was 1 sec. delay in live conversation sometimes
* Tried recording to hard disk but it was very slow, the system usually hanged eventually
* On a 32bit box we couldn't get more then 350 threads out of it. Shrinking the thread stack size did not help either. With a 64-bit OS, that problem never occurred. (exact same hardware)
