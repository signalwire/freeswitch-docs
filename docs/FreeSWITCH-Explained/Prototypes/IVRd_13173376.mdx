# IVRd 

 

## About

The FreeSWITCH IVR daemon ("ivrd") is a handy abstraction layer that sits on top of the [ESL](../Modules/mod_esl_6587340.mdx#about). The basic idea is that the ivrd will allow the user to have a STDIN/STDOUT interface for simple call control. This makes it even easier to use the powerful event socket for handling calls.

## Requirements

There are a few prerequisites that you will need:

* Executable script that can read/write to STDIN/STDOUT
* An unblocked TCP/UDP port where the ivrd can listen for socket connections
* If using **ESL::IVR** module then ESL's **perlmod** needs to be built
* At least one dialplan extension that sets the **ivr\_path** variable and calls the **socket** application

## Launching the daemon

The daemon must be left running in it's own process. We recommend using GNU **screen** and leaving the ivrd running in the foreground on one of the screens.

Launch the ivrd and specify the host and port:

```bash
/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_ivrd -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9090
```

The daemon will be listening for socket connections on port 9090\. (Use whichever port suits you.) The daemon can listen for connections on the localhost or on a different host. Be sure that you have good network connectivity between the host and the daemon if they are not on the same machine.

## Examples

Using the ivrd launched above (localhost, port 9090), here is a simple dialplan entry:

```xml
<extension name="ivrd-example1">
   <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(995\d)$">
     <action application="log" data="INFO Let's do some ivrd, shall we?"/>
     <action application="set" data="ivr_path=/usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/ivrd-hello_world.pl"/>
     <action application="socket" data="127.0.0.1:9090 full"/>
   </condition>                     
 </extension>
```

Note how we set the channel variable **ivr\_path** before calling the **socket** app. The **ivr\_path** variable must contain the name of an _executable_ script. Below is an example of such a script:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# ivrd-hello_world.pl                 
#
# Launched from FreeSWITCH using socket app and ${ivr_path} variable
#
use strict;
use warnings;

# Use lib is easy, but you can also install your ESL.pm and esl/perl/ESL/* into site_perl
use lib '/usr/src/freeswitch/libs/esl/perl';  
use ESL::IVR
                        
$| = 1;        # Turn off buffering
select STDERR; # We'll take this stream, thanks
print "Starting ivrd-hello_world.pl...\n\n";

## Set the root dir for sound files
my $sound_root = '/usr/local/freeswitch/sounds/en/us/callie';
                         
## Create the connection object which is basically an IVR
my $con = new ESL::IVR;  

## Get this channel's uuid and dialed number
my $uuid = $con->{_uuid};
my $dest = $con->getVar('destination_number');
                         
## Answer call, sleep for half second to let media get up and running
$con->execute('answer','',$uuid);
$con->execute('sleep','500');
                                                                                           
## Play a simple greeting        
$con->playback('ivr/ivr-welcome_to_freeswitch.wav'); 

## Tell the call what he/she dialed
$con->execute('sleep','500');
$con->execute('say', "en number iterated $dest");

## Politely disconnect             
$con->execute('sleep','1000');
$con->playback('ivr/ivr-thank_you.wav');
$con->execute('sleep','500');
$con->playback('voicemail/vm-goodbye.wav');
```

### Perl ESL::IVR Syntax

The $con object above has very simple syntax:

Get or Set a channel variable:

```perl
my $script_var = $con->getVar('var_name');
$con->setVar('var_name','var_value_to_set');
```

Execute an API:

```perl
my $result = $con->api('api_name','api args here');
```

Execute a dialplan application:

```perl
$con->execute('app_name','app args here');
```

Playback shortcut:

```perl
$con->playback('/path/to/sound/file.wav');
```

PlayAndGetDigits shortcut:

```perl
my $digits = $con->read('min', 'max', 'tries',
                        'timeout', 'termination_digits',
                        '/path/to/file.wav',
                        '/path/to/invalid_msg_file.wav',
                        'chan_var', 'regex');
```

Read shortcut:

```perl
my $digits = $con->read('min', 'max', 'chan_var',
                        '/path/to/file.wav',
                        'timeout', 'termination_digits');
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues, like "socket errors" on the FS CLI then check a few things:

* Confirm that the port number of the daemon and the socket app are the same
* Test your extension using **nc** as described [here](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/Event-Socket-Outbound_3375460.mdx#faq)
* Make sure that your script is executable
* Run your script from the command line and confirm that there are no syntax errors
