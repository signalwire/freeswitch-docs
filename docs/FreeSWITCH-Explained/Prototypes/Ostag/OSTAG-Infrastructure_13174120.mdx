## Overall thoughts

* Things stay in an "incubator" status (in case they die) until they become official projects. This will prevent the main project area from becoming cluttered, and also allows for cleanup of old, dead projects.
* Build mobile support for any of this?

## Backend

[ostag](./index.mdx#about)

* Need monitoring for all this stuff  
   * (Nagios and MRTG... Who's taking the notification pages?)  
   * ZABBIX... ZABBIX... ZABBIX.
* Signup page to start this all  
   * (Likely a custom script to build the project skel, setup the wiki, create vhosts for the project, ftp space, svn, telephone context, IRC registration/web client..)  
   * Could be just a range of scripts that take values from LDAP and shovel them in the right places.
* Single sign-on  
   * OpenID using Crowd potentially.  
   * I would leave it with basic LDAP. OpenID is groovy, crowd is atlassian centric. OpenSSO is nice but they are all made for > 500k users and have the maintenance work of a system for that scale.
* Good backup solution  
   * [bacula](http://www.bacula.org/)  
   * [rsnapshot](http://www.rsnapshot.org/) nice and easy
* Good speed/performance  
   * Alot of this is java.. we'll need big boxes, lots of mem and lots of spindle speed to throw at this...

You can run all of this on glassfish in one instance and therewith have a single JVM run it all ... If it gets to heavy, just add a second box with glassfish and cluster glassfish. it has support for that built in

## Things we want to support...

SSO (Using Crowd's ldap backed OpenID) for the following services [\[1\]](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Crowd+Documentation)

* Private emails for the subdomain  
   * General ones (like consulting)  
   * Private ones (just redirect to personal email)
* Auto-create subdomain for project
* WIKI  
   * [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.com/)  
   * [Confluence](http://www.confluence.com/)  
   * [XWIKI](http://www.xwiki.org/) Provides nice multilingual support .. ldap authorisation and loads of modules.  
   * Maybe a pre-built portal/template that includes things like "what's been updated in my project"
* Subversion
* OpenGROK
* Fisheye
* Crucible
* Jive Forums?
* Mailing lists  
   * [OpenIDEnabled](http://openidenabled.com/unsupported-software/)  
   * [Nabble2](http://www.nabble2.com/)

Quite a bit of this can be made with an apache skeleton for new projects, which can be put into the openID framework too.. (apache supports openID)

* Auto-generate IRC channel based on name  
   * Register with ChanServ  
   * Generate links/instructions for how to add an IRC web client for the user to use  
   * etc.
* Real-time telephony communication automatically setup  
   * Pre-defined / automatic conference room generation  
   * Possibly give people their own context, mapped to their domain

## Other suggestions for the name

OSTDG - Open Source Telephony Drinking Group
