##   
Introduction

Freeswitch has great fax capabilities using mod\_spandsp. This article is intended to take this concept one step further: to implement an easy user interface to this capability in the way of having a print queue using CUPS.

## Compatibility

This was all set up using Debian 6 (Squeeze), but should be applicable to any system that is compatible with CUPS. Some paths will be different. If you have some examples using other OS's please feel free to add them here. If you have any questions, please contact bdfoster (at) endigotech (dot) com or send me a message on IRC (bdfoster).

## Alright, so here we go!

  
First step is to add some sort of CUPS backend to feed faxes to FreeSWITCH.

On Debian 6:

```xml
mkdir -p /var/spool/fsfax
chmod 1777 /var/spool/fsfax
mkdir /usr/lib/cups/fsfax
chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/fsfax
```
