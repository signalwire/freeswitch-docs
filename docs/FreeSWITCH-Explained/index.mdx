# FreeSWITCH Explained 

## Start Here  

Welcome to FreeSWITCH™, the future of telephony.

The documentation is not perfect, and we rely on your help to suggest improvements from a fresh perspective.

## What Is FreeSWITCH?

FreeSWITCH™ is an open source carrier-grade telephony platform implemented as a back-to-back user agent. Because of this design it can perform a great number of different tasks from a PBX to transit switch, TTS (text-to-speech) conversion, audio and video conferencing host, VoIP telephone, and more.

## Documentation

Our documentation parallels the ongoing development by the FreeSWITCH™ core development team in concert with contributions from the open source user community. With your help, the docs will always track the latest version of code available from the git repository.

The documentation provides usage prototypes and examples for the channel variables, dialplan applications, and API commands that can be accessed via E.S.L. (the Event Socket Layer) with scripts written in Lua, Perl, and other languages.

NOTE: The tagging system needs to be rebuilt using Docusaurus tags instead of Confluence Labels. See https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch-docs/issues/79 for more information.

Pages tagged with the label "[examples](/tags/examples)" provide reference information to configure and experiment with FreeSWITCH. Be sure to click on the labels to find pages that related to that topic.

Reference documentation of core API functions can be found on [FreeSWITCH Tech Reference](http://docs.freeswitch.org/).
