## Needs Attention

### Holding Bin

The page entitled [Holding Bin](../../Configuration/How-Tos/Holding-Bin_1966771.mdx#tls) is a nice place to store useful information before there exists a final destination for it. Many of these notes and ideas come from the development team and power users on the IRC channel and are too valuable to be lost to time.

If you see a section in the [Holding Bin](../../Configuration/How-Tos/Holding-Bin_1966771.mdx#tls) that now has a page that is a good place to contain it, please move it to there and embellish the narrative to make it readable and useful.
