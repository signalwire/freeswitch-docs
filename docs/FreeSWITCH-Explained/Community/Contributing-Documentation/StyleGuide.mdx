# FreeSWITCH Style Guide

## About

Documentation Team: Please observe these standards and guidelines when editing wiki pages to maintain a consistent user experience.

## Structure

- Begin each page with a Heading 2 `##` named "About" followed by a brief description of the page.
- After that comes whatever commands, variables, narrative, diagrams, tables, and code examples are appropriate.
- Add tags to the page's front matter as appropriate. 

### Typical Page Structure

```
## About

This is the About text.

## Heading 2

First major paragraph.

### Heading 3

Text under heading 3

### Another Heading 3

Other text under next heading 3

#### Heading 4

Text

#### Another Heading 4

Text

## Another Heading 2

Second major paragraph.

```

## Commands

### BNF Formatting

Commands are expressed using Backus–Naur Form as outlined in the table below.

|              |                           |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| literal      | a literal argument        |
| \<variable>  | a variable argument       |
| \[optional\] | an optional argument      |
| \|           | symbol for or             |
| &            | symbol for and            |
| \*           | wildcard character        |
| ...          | symbol for repetition     |
| ?            | single character wildcard |
| (grouping)   | override precedence       |

### Command Format

Command name

Brief description of command.

Usage, styled as Preformatted text (shortcut = Ctrl+7), beginning with the string "Usage:"

Listing of arguments and their meaning, one per line

Notes, warnings, additional explanation as necessary.

**Example of command 'alias'**

### alias

A means to save some keystrokes on commonly used commands.

Usage: alias add | stickyadd \<alias> \<command> | del \<alias> | *

add - add an alias  
stickyadd - add an alias which persists across restarts  
\<alias> - the user defined name for the new command  
\<command> - the original command name

Examples:

alias add reloadall reloadacl reloadxml  
alias add unreg sofia profile internal flush_inbound_reg  
alias stickyadd reloadall reloadacl reloadxml  
alias del reloadall

Only really works from the console, not fs\_cli.

## Paths

**conf/** in the docs represents the generalized location of the FreeSWITCH™ parent configuration directory. 
- Linux packages place config files under `/etc/freeswitch` while compiling from source typically locates them under the `/usr/local/freeswitch/conf` tree. 
- Windows clearly uses a different location. 

:::warning

Don't use hard-coded paths to the configuration files if possible.

:::

## Styling

FreeSWITCH's docs are written in Markdown, hosted with Docusaurus.

See [Docusaurus' Markdown Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for an orientation and best practice.

Please use the following conventions to maintain consistency:

### Heading Levels

Docusaurus uses Heading 1 for the page title and begins actual headings at Heading 2.

```
##  Use Heading 2 for top-level headings.

###  Use Heading 3 for sub-sections under Heading 2

####  Use Heading 4 for sub-sections under Heading 3.
```

:::info

Our Table of Contents configuration only includes heading levels 2-3 by default.

:::

:::info

Heading levels not only style the text visually, they also provide semantic hints to screen readers for those with vision impairment.

:::

### Text Styles

Please do not use boldface and italics except where they are appropriate. Let the style sheet do its job:

1. Paste or type the new text first
2. Style the text (see Shortcut keys)

Random text styles circumvent these useful goals, plus they can be used to excess and dilute the emphasis. Use **callouts** to set out text in place of their wiki equivalents.

### Commands and Log Output

Surround *inline* commands and log output with backticks `` ` ``. For multiple lines, use code blocks.

**Example:**

```Run `grok` ```

*becomes*

Run `grok`


### Code Blocks

Use [Code Blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks) to enclose multi-line blocks of XML, HTML, C, bash scripts, output, and other text where monospace is appropriate.

- Begin and end code blocks with three backticks ` ``` ` on their own line. 
- Specify the language for syntax highlighting if desired.
- Add a title for the block if appropriate.

**Example:**

```` 
```md title="Block Title" 
- Something
- Something else
```
````

*becomes*

```md title=Block Title
- Something 
- Something else
```

### Callouts

Use [Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for callout blocks (e.g. Info, Warning, Danger).

- Callout blocks are defined with three colons `:::`. 
- The first line also indicates what *style* of callout block it is. There are five styles: `note`, `tip`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`.
- Include a blank line both before and after the three-colon lines.

**Example:**

```

:::warning

Sample warning block

:::


```

*becomes*

:::warning

Sample warning block

:::

#### Recommended Callout Usage:

:::info

Use `info` for something you want to draw the reader's attention to, that isn't critical if they miss.

Markdown offers `note`, `tip`, and `info`. These are very similar; use `info` if you're not sure which to use. This gives consistent color and formatting.

:::

:::warning

Use `warning` to alert the user to something that would cause unwanted behavior, but won't have major lasting consequences.

Put this *before* the action it refers to.

:::

:::danger

Use `danger` for anything that may cause significant real-world consequences, such as unrecoverable failure, data loss, security breach, fraud, etc.

Put this *before* the action it refers to.

:::

## Diagrams

Docusaurus offers Mermaid integration for diagrams. As of this writing, there is no official guidance for use.

## Tags

Docusaurus [tags](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc#doc-tags) in the front matter are the successor to Confluence *labels*.

- Use plural words for everything other than proper terms used in FreeSWITCH, such as "variables", "modules", etc. 
- Exceptions include "dialplan" and "directory" since these proper names are used internally to FS.
- Tags tie together related pages. Please don't create a new tag if you can find an existing tag.

## FreeSWITCH Trademark

Our trademark is FreeSWITCH™. You do not have to use the trademark symbol every time. It appears in every instance on the top level page so hopefully that should drive the point home. If you use it once in the About section of a new page that should be sufficient. In many cases the old wiki used the abbreviation FS to represent FreeSWITCH which should be acceptable as long as it is clear what is meant; just make sure it can't be conflated with "file server".
