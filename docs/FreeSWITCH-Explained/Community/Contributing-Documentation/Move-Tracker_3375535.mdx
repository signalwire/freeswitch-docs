## About

## Status Modes

Pending — nothing has been done with the old wiki page.

Editing — a Docs Team member is currently editing the page, this status "locks" it so consult with him before performing any actions on it.

Moved — the page has been copied from the old wiki to Confluence, but no formatting nor vetting of the validity of the page has been performed.

Complete — the page has been copied, formatted, and is ready for public consumption.

Delete — the page is outdated or otherwise not needed on Confluence, ignore it.

Duplicate — usually a redirected wiki link, no need to copy page.

Request-delete — if not sure if page should be deleted, mark it Request-delete and a developer will be asked if it is needed.
