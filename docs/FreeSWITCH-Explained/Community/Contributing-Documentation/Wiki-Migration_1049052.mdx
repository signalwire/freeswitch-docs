# Wiki Migration 

 

This page discusses the migration of documentation pages from the old MediaWiki platform to the Atlassian Confluence wiki.

## Wiki Page Move Steps

Please follow these steps, especially during a docs sprint, to copy pages from the old MediaWiki to Confluence:

* Select a page marked “Pending" on the [spreadsheet](./index.mdx) to copy
* Change Status to “Editing" and type your handle/name in the “Editor" column
* Immediately copy the wiki page over to a new page in Confluence  
   * Navigate to the desired parent page on Confluence  
   * Click the CREATE button at the top to create a new child page under it  
   * Select the FS template (which is of course ALLLLLLLLL the way at the bottom of the list)  
   * Paste the page title or type a new one (this will become part of the hyperlink to the new page, so choose wisely)  
   * Copy or type 1 or 2 short sentences under the About section describing the contents of the page.  
   * Select the entire old MediaWiki page contents BELOW the Table of Contents and copy  
   * Move the cursor to the Confluence page after a couple CR/NL below the ToC macro and paste the entire wiki page contents
* If you wish to edit the page to place code in the `{code` block or other pretty-fying, do those edits
* Type a short message in the description box at the bottom
* Check "Notify watchers" if you want HipChat and other followers to receive an update about the page edit
* Click Save and check your work
* **Go back to the spreadsheet to mark this page as "Moved" if there is more work to be done, or "Complete" if it needs no more editing**

We are most interested in copying all the pages from the old wiki as quickly as possible. The editing, formatting, and making pretty can be done later once all the pages have been migrated.

Thanks!

## Announcement of Wiki Migration

FreeSWITCHers,

We are starting the migration from MediaWiki to Confluence Wiki, we’ve tried various ways to import the data we have now and it didn’t end well at all. We would have to do more work to fix all those broken links. So we are fleshing out the new layout and migrating the data little by little from MediaWiki to Confluence. This is the time for everyone who can’t contribute code to step up and give back to the community.

If you want an account to the sandbox area to assist in migrating the documentation we have, formatting it and reading thru it as we migrate it over from MediaWiki, please sign up for an account at [FreeSWITCH](https://auth.freeswitch.org) then email [brian@freeswitch.org](mailto:brian@freeswitch.org) or [wking@freeswitch.org](mailto:wking@freeswitch.org) to be added to the confluence editors group. We need as many hands as possible working on this to get it done quickly. Once the migration is complete we’ll go thru and fill in docs on areas that are currently either missing or not well thought out. The new wiki will not copy the layout exactly as it appears on MediaWiki, but Confluence provides a more well thought-out table of contents.

General Confluence information can be found [Here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+User%27s+Guide)

Quick Start

Please take a moment to review the [Confluence Wiki Standards and Guidelines](./Confluence-Wiki-Standards-and-Guidelines_1049056.mdx) page prior to making changes.

## Why Are We Migrating?

* to start fresh with a new, well thought out layout and ToC
* integration with Jira?
* Because we have nothing better to do ![(wink)](/images/icons/emoticons/wink.svg)
