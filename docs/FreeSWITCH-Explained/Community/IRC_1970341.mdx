## About

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channels used by the FreeSWITCH Open Source Community Project.

## Channels

FreeSWITCH IRC channels are hosted on the [Freenode IRC network](http://www.freenode.net) ([FAQ](http://freenode.net/faq.shtml)).

You can connect to Freenode on [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net). Local servers and IPv6 are [available](http://freenode.net/irc%5Fservers.shtml).

## Netiquette 

* Please do not use a generic username such as fsuser, change your /nick after logging in.
* Please do not flood our channel. **If you are copy and pasting more than 1-2 lines please use our** [pastebin](http://pastebin.freeswitch.org)!
* Do not ask to ask a question. Just ask.
* Do not be rude, crude or otherwise socially unacceptable.
* Do not spam or flood the channel.
* Please feel free to \~take-a-number, which lets users joining the channel later see your pending question.
* If no one answers your question immediately then it may be that no one in the channel knows the answer, or they're busy or away. Please wait before repeating your question, \~take-a-number, or try later in the day (hint the main developers are in the U.S. so probably won't be online if it's nighttime there).  
   * If you don't get an answer for a long time, try "escalating" it to the mailing list, which has more eyes, but DO NOT ask the same question on both IRC and the mailing list; **choose one or the other**.
* FreeSWITCH is a free product and the users in the channel are volunteers contributing their time to the project. Please take this into account when asking questions and do not expect a speedy response. If this is not sufficient for you then commercial support is available by sending email to [consulting@freeswitch.org](mailto:consulting@freeswitch.org).
* [See also](http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc)

If you would like to contribute, please feel free to hang around in the channel. Especially as a beginner you will learn much about FreeSWITCH and soon you will be able to answer other people's questions to keep the cycle going.

##  Bot 

We have a robot, c888 who helps run the channel. When (s)he's not AWOL, which happens a lot.

## User Commands 

Commands can be used either in the main channel or in a PM with c888.

###  \~take-a-number $question 

Stores your question in the [waiting list](http://conference.freeswitch.org/waiting.cgi). This means people can come online later and check what questions are currently waiting for an answer.

```xml
 <newfsuser> ~take-a-number How do I configure FS to make me coffee in the morning
 <@c888> newfsuser, you are number 5
```

Please remember to pop your question if you have discovered an answer. If a member of the developer team helps you, he will pop the question off the stack.

You can only have a single question in the list at a time. If you want to ask another question, pop your question then take a new number.

Your question will be automatically removed if you leave the channel. If you rejoin the channel you will need to take another number. Questions aren't answered in number order, but in the order people wish to answer them in based on their knowledge and experience.

###  \~popme 

Removes your question from the [waiting list](http://conference.freeswitch.org/waiting.cgi).

```xml
<newfsuser> ~popme
<@c888> 5 newfsuser: (04/20/12 08:18:35 How do I configure FS to make me coffee in the morning
```

### \~wiki $query

```

### \~bug FS-XXXX

###  s/$old_text/$new_text/\[g\]

<@c888> What newfsuser meant to say was... FreeSWITCH is awesome
```

The optional /g flag replaces all occurences of $old\_text.

```

### \~whatis $query

Displays a definition from the bot's database.

```xml
<newfsuser> ~whatis pastebin
<c888> Pastebin is a nice place to paste things so you don't flood the channel: http://pastebin:freeswitch@pastebin.freeswitch.org

<newfsuser> ~whatis jira
<@c888> Jira is our bug tracker at: https://freeswitch.org/jira/

```

## Admin commands

##  IRC Clients 

You can use many IRC chat clients to connect such as [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/), [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com) and [Icechat](http://icechat.net) for Windows, [Limechat](http://limechat.net/mac/) for macOS, [Irssi](http://www.irssi.org/), [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) or [XChat](http://www.xchat.org) for Unix-like systems, [ChatZilla](http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/) for Mozilla browsers or any other standard IRC program.

Your organization may block IRC access as it is barred by IT departmental polices. If so, try using the [FreeSWITCH](http://conference.freeswitch.org/) or [freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/) web clients.
