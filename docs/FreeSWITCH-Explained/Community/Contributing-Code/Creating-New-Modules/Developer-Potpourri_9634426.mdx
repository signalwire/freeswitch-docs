## About

There are lots of tidbits that don't easily fall into a specific category for developers, so here are some miscellaneous and somewhat random tips that have been gleaned from conversations with the FreeSWITCH™ authors.

## Apache Portable Runtime

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [Apache Portable Runtime (APR)](https://apr.apache.org/) \- it contains lots of handy functions, data types, objects, etc. that make FreeSWITCH™ development a bit easier and more consistent across platforms. To prevent namespace collisions, **`apr_`** objects have been mapped to the **`switch_`** namespace. Please use the **`switch_`** versions of **`apr_`** objects. (Note: there is an exception to this - **`libmrcp`**). Examples:

`**switch_file_open**` in place of `**apr_file_open**`  
`**switch_file_read**` in place of `**apr_file_read**`  
`**switch_file_write**` in place of `**apr_file_write**`  
`**switch_file_close**` in place of `**apr_file_close**`

You get the idea. See **`switch_apr.c`** for LOTS of great detail.

## Channel Data

When writing your own application within FreeSWITCH™, you can use `switch_channel_set_private` to create a hash in which you can put data specific to your own application. Example:

```xml
switch_channel_set_private(channel, "mydata", some_pointer_to_my_data);
...
some_pointer_to_my_data = switch_channel_get_private(channel, "mydata");
```

When debug printing, consider using alternatives to raw `**printf()**` calls. Raw `printf()` calls require a STDOUT which is not always available, i.e. when running as a service under Windows or under certain circumstances when running as a daemon under Linux/Unix. Better options are available:

* `*** switch_log_printf()**` \- the most generic way to print a debug message. Allows for debug levels and printing messages to disk files, remote apps, etc. See [here](http://docs.freeswitch.org/group%5F%5Flog.html#ga3) and [here](http://docs.freeswitch.org/switch%5F%5Flog%5F8c.html#a12) for more information.
* `**stream->write_function()**` \- more memory efficient; this avoids a `**malloc()**` call and therefore has a lesser impact on program performance. See [here](http://docs.freeswitch.org/structswitch%5F%5Fstream%5F%5Fhandle.html) for more information.
