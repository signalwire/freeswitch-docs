# Janitorial Tasks 

 

1. Auditing all Freeswitch modules and fix command and option help and auto complete
2. Fixing the Doxygen docs
3. Audit and compile list of clang(latest) compiler warnings(enabled with -Weverything) with which FS fails to build

Fix/Triage one of the issues reported by clang static analysis: `[http://files.freeswitch.org/eg/clang-sa/](http://files.freeswitch.org/eg/clang-sa/)`

Module requests:

mod\_hiredis -> replacement for mod\_redis which should use the system library of hiredis if available. Should also consider if there is any missing functionality that would be simple to add.
