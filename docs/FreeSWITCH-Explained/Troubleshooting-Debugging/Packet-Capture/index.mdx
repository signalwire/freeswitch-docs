# Packet Capture 

 

## About

Capturing SIP and RTP packets can reveal trouble with the configuration of FreeSWITCH or the endpoints connecting to it. A packet capture might be required by developers to help troubleshoot your installation.

## tcpdump

SRC: [http://www.tcpdump.org/](http://www.tcpdump.org/)

Use tcpdump if you want a pcap to open up in Wireshark later. Else, use tshark if you want a "text only" view of the SIP traffic without all the headers and extra information.

### Examples

#### Basic Logging

Real-time traffic dump (full packets) to stdout:

  tcpdump -nq -s 0 -A -vvv -i eth0 port 5060

Dump to file:

  tcpdump -nq -s 0 -i eth0 -w /tmp/dump.pcap port 5060 

Save a new time-stamped file approximately once per hour on the specified port

  tcpdump -nq -s 0 -i eth0 -G3600 -w /tmp/trace/sip-%F--%H-%M-%S.pcap port 5060

Daemonize and log 2 ports, rotate log every hour.

  nohup tcpdump -nq -s 0 -i eth0 -G3600 -w /tmp/trace/sip-%F--%H-%M-%S.pcap port 5080 or port 5060 &

Daemonize and log 2 ports, rotate log every hour, and place into hierarchical directory structure.

**tcpdump log example**

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 TD=`pidof tcpdump`
 if [ -n "$TD" ]; then
   kill "$TD"
 fi

 DIRS="/var/spool/pcap/`/bin/date '+%Y'`/ /var/spool/pcap/`/bin/date '+%Y'`/`/bin/date '+%m'`/ /var/spool/pcap/`/bin/date '+%Y'`/`/bin/date '+%m'`/`/bin/date '+%d'`/"
 for DIR in $DIRS
 do
   if [ ! -d "$DIR" ]; then
     mkdir "$DIR"
   fi
 done

 nohup tcpdump -nq -s 0 -i eth0 -G3600 -w '/var/spool/pcap/%Y/%m/%d/%H%M%S.pcap' port 5060 or port 5080 &> /opt/freeswitch/log/tcpdump.log &
```

This should be run from cron / init services at the first minute of each new day.

#### Capturing Calls For a Specific User 

  sofia status profile $profile user $user_id

to get the remote ip/and port, then use:

  tcpdump -i $INTERFACE -s 1500 -A host $IPADDRESS and port $SIPPORT

####  Using Wireshark to Analyze pcap Files 

Wireshark has some nice tools for analyzing your packet captures. See the tutorial linked at the bottom of this page for tips.

## pcapsipdump

SRC: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcapsipdump/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcapsipdump/)  
 DESC: pcapsipdump is a tool for dumping SIP sessions (+RTP traffic, if available) to disk in a fashion similar to "tcpdump -w" (format is exactly the same), but one file per sip session (even if there are thousands of concurrect SIP sessions). As of SVN r128, there is limited but functional support for SIP over TCP. This functionality is not enabled by default and requires a specific make command:

make CXXFLAGS=-DUSE_TCP=1

The pcapsipdump program will attempt to capture SIP dialogs regardless of port number. Note that older versions of pcapsipdump do only port 5060\. The trunk version of pcapsipdump is stable and is good for most production environments.

### Example

```xml
/* store all SIP sessions on tmp folder */
pcapsipdump -i eth0 -d /tmp/

pcapsipdump version 0.2-trunk
Usage: pcapsipdump [-fpUt] [-i <interface> | -r <file>] [-d <working directory>]
                   [-v level] [-R filter] [-m filter] [-n filter] [-l filter]
                   [-B size] [-T limit] [-t trigger:action:param] [expression]
 -f   Do not fork or detach from controlling terminal.
 -p   Do not put the interface into promiscuous mode.
 -U   Make .pcap files writing 'packet-buffered' - slower method,
      but you can use partitially written file anytime, it will be consistent.
 -i   Specify network interface name (i.e. eth0, em1, ppp0, etc).
 -r   Read from .pcap file instead of network interface.
 -v   Set verbosity level (higher is more verbose).
 -B   Set the operating system capture buffer size, a.k.a. ring buffer size.
      This can be expressed in bytes/KB(*1000)/KiB(*1024)/MB/MiB/GB/GiB. ex.: '-B 64MiB'
      Set this to few MiB or more to avoid packets dropped by kernel.
 -R   RTP filter. Specifies what kind of RTP information to include in capture:
      'rtp+rtcp' (default), 'rtp', 'rtpevent', 't38', or 'none'.
 -m   Method-filter. Default is '^(INVITE|OPTIONS|REGISTER)$'
 -n   Number-filter. Only calls to/from specified number will be recorded
      Argument is a regular expression. See 'man 7 regex' for details.
 -l   Record only each N-th call (i.e. '-l 3' = record only each third call)
 -d   Set directory (or filename template), where captured files will be stored.
      ex.: -d /var/spool/pcapsipdump/%Y%m%d/%H/%Y%m%d-%H%M%S-%f-%t-%i.pcap
 -T   Unconditionally stop recording a call after it was active for this many seconds.
      Might be useful for broken peers that keep sending RTP long after call ended.
 -t   <trigger>:<action>:<parameter>. Parameter is %-expanded (see below)
      Triggers: open = when opening a new .pcap file; close = when closing
      Actions and their parameters:
      mv:<directory> - move .pcap files to <directory> (using /bin/mv)
      exec:"/bin/blah args..." - fork and execute /bin/blah with arguments
      sh:"shell code" - fork and execute /bin/sh -c "shell code"
 *    Following %-codes are expanded in -d and -t: %f (from/caller), %t (to/callee),
      %i (call-id), and call date/time (see 'man 3 strftime' for details)
 *    Trailing argument is pcap filter expression syntax, see 'man 7 pcap-filter'

Filter on RTCP packets reporting any packet loss or jitter over 30ms
EXAMPLE: tshark -i eth0 -o "rtp.heuristic_rtp: TRUE" -R 'rtcp.ssrc.fraction >= 1 or rtcp.ssrc.jitter >= 240' -V


Filter on SIP and all RTP packets
EXAMPLE: tshark -S -w capture.pcap -f "(udp port sip) or (udp[1] & 1 != 1 && udp[3] & 1 != 1 && udp[8] & 0x80 == 0x80 && length < 250)"


Capture all SIP on specified port and switch files every hour
tshark -nq -i eth0 -b duration:3600 -w /tmp/trace/sip.pcap port 5080

## sngrep

SRC: irontec on [github](https://github.com/irontec/sngrep)

DESC: Linux/OSX console-based SIP traffic viewer with filtering capabilities

sngrep is a handy utility for quickly capturing and viewing SIP traffic. It can be run on existing pcap files or it can capture traffic live. It can filter based on many criteria, including source/destination as well as message type. This is particularly useful when you have a lot of SIP traffic on a system and you need to find a specific dialog or message. (Have you ever wanted to see only NOTIFY traffic without being bombarded with REGISTERs, OPTIONS, and INVITEs? Or just INVITEs without all the other SIP traffic? If so, sngrep is the tool for you.) Once you find a dialog you can explicitly export it to a pcap file. The irontec github page has several [screen shots](https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/wiki/Screenshots) that demonstrate its capabilities. Note that sngrep does not capture RTP, only SIP.

An especially useful feature of sngrep is its ability to create SIP "ladder graphs" showing the progression of the SIP dialog. The ladder graph appears on the left and the content of the highlighted SIP message appears on the right. Scroll up and down and you can quickly review the progression of a SIP dialog. Being able to see this right at the Linux/OSX command line can save you the effort of having to export a potentially large pcap file and open in Wireshark. Also, sngrep works well in conjunction with Wireshark. Use sngrep to locate quickly specific SIP traffic and then export a pcap to Wireshark for more detailed analysis.

    -d --device          Use this capture device instead of default
    -I --input           Read captured data from pcap file
    -O --output          Write captured data to pcap file
    -c --calls           Only display dialogs starting with INVITE
    -r --rtp             Capture RTP packets payload
    -l --limit           Set capture limit to N dialogs
    -i --icase           Make <match expression> case insensitive
    -v --invert          Invert <match expression>
    -N --no-interface    Don't display sngrep interface, just capture
    -q --quiet           Don't print captured dialogs in no interface mode
    -D --dump-config     Print active configuration settings and exit
    -f --config          Read configuration from file
    -F --no-config       Do not read configuration from default config file
    -R --rotate          Rotate calls when capture limit have been reached
 
Examples:
# look at live SIP traffic on default interface:
sngrep
 
# look at live SIP traffic on specified interface:
sngrep -d eth0
 
# look at live SIP traffic, calls only (i.e. INVITEs):
sngrep -c
 
# look at live SIP traffic for with SIP from or two containing a name or number:
sngrep 1000
sngrep someuser
 
# look at live SIP traffic, calls/INVITEs only, for with SIP from or two containing a name or number: 
sngrep -c 1000
sngrep -c someuser

# open an existing pcap file and review all SIP traffic:
sngrep -I filename.pcap
 
# open an existing pcap file and review SIP calls only:
sngrep -c -I filename.pcap


```

### Tips for using sngrep interface

Arrow up and down to move selector and press \<enter> to open a specific dialog. This brings up the ladder-graph and all messages within the dialog.

View multiple (perhaps related) dialogs in a single ladder-graph by selecting them with the space bar. Press \<enter> when all dialogs have been selected and a multi-endpoint ladder-graph will be displayed. 

Change display filter by pressing F7\. You can select To: and From:, source and destination, payload, and SIP message types.

Export selected dialogs by pressing F2.

Search through dialogs by pressing F3.

## Truncate a pcap File

### With The Wireshark GUI  

Open the pcap, then click "Save as". Look at the options - from frame $x to $y, the marked ones, from the first marked one to the last marked one, etc. To mark packets, you can right–click them in the viewer.

### editcap

If you have a large pcap from any of the above methods and want to share part of it, you can use the "editcap" command line program that comes with Wireshark. Read the [full manual](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/editcap.html).

In short, if you want just packets $x to $y, use:

editcap -r $source_infile $outfile $x-$y

where -r means "only include x-y" otherwise without -r, this command would cut out x-y

If you want to omit some packets, then skip the -r and list the ones to omit, e.g. to omit packets 1000 to 3000:

editcap $source_infile $outfile 1000-3000

## TLS with sharka  

after some experimentation with various tools, I come out with a little shell tool that maybe can be useful to you too.  
It can only work with non-forward secrecy ciphers, obviously, and only if is started before the client do the initial TLS handshake (eg, just restart the client). Forward secrecy cannot be decrypted after fact, so don't waste effort.

An example of ciphers that can be decrypted are the "AES256-SHA" openssl cipher group. In FreeSWITCH, edit vars.xml and put

`<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="sip_tls_ciphers=AES256-SHA"/>`

You can use ssldump to check what cipher is used by serverhello.

Enjoy, make it better, and share it :)

# create fifo pipe, then will send the content from fifo pipe to an sngrep without gui, which will be reading pcap from stdin, and sending eep packets to the other sngrep (third terminal)

mkfifo /tmp/pipe
cat /tmp/pipe | sngrep -N -q -H udp:127.0.0.1:5077 -I -

#second ssh terminal
# writes as pcap to fifo pipe what freeswitch writes and reads from ssl lib

python ssl_logger_giova.py -pcap /tmp/pipe freeswitch

#third ssh terminal
# sngrep that receives packets from both the Ethernet device, and the eep packets sent by the other sngrep (eg, the tls packets ssl_logger grabs from freeswitch's ssl lib)

sngrep -L udp:127.0.0.1:5077

(you may want to edit ssl_logger.py and change 228 to be 101 - LINKTYPE_IPV4 to be LINKTYPE_RAW )

## Example Analyses  

### SIP TLS with sharka  

Edit the script first few lines with your own values.

Visualize the packets related to "1010@[pbx.example.com](http://pbx.example.com)"  

**sharka example**

```text
sharka "1010@pbx.example.com"
```

### SIP TLS on port 5061

Replace 4.2.2.2 with your own IP address.

**Wireshark example**

```text
wireshark -o "ssl.desegment_ssl_records: TRUE" \
  -o "ssl.desegment_ssl_application_data: TRUE" \
  -o "ssl.keys_list: 4.2.2.2,5061,sip,/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/ssl/agent.pem" \
  -o "ssl.debug_file: /tmp/wireshark.log" \
  -i eth0 
  -f "tcp port 5061"
```

**tshark example**

```text
tshark -o "ssl.desegment_ssl_records: TRUE" \
  -o "ssl.desegment_ssl_application_data: TRUE" \
  -o "ssl.keys_list: 4.2.2.2,5061,sip,/opt/freeswitch/conf/ssl/agent.pem" \
  -o "ssl.debug_file:/tmp/tshark.log" \
  -i eth0 \
  -f "tcp port 5061"
```

### RTP events

**RTP analysis example**

```text
tshark -o "rtp.heuristic_rtp: TRUE" -R rtpevent
or with tethereal:
tethereal -o "rtp.heuristic_rtp: TRUE" -R rtpevent
```

### Analyze RTP Quality

sudo tshark -q -f 'udp portrange 16384-32768' -o rtp.heuristic_rtp:TRUE -z rtp,streams

If you're doing long-term captures, you may want to get a bit more paranoid about security:

sudo setuid 4755 /usr/bin/dumpcap
dumpcap -f 'udp portrange 16384-32768' -i eth0 -w /tmp/qos.pcap
tshark -qr /tmp/qos.pcap -o rtp.heuristic_rtp:TRUE -z rtp,streams  
 
### Remote live capture with local wireshark

you can also use tcpdump in conjunction with ssh to bring the packets back to your workstation so you can watch it live in Wireshark. Something to bare in mind with this approach is you must set the filter on the tcpdump or you are going to end up with either echoed data, or to much data.

#### Windows workstation to remote linux server

with wireshark and putty installed locally and tcpdump installed on the remote server

```powershell
"C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\plink.exe" -ssh root@{server} "tcpdump -ni {server_interface} -s 0 -w - port 5060 or portrange 16384-32768" | "c:\Program Files\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe" -k -i -
```
