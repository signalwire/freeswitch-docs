# Troubleshooting Freeswitch 

## About

You need not recompile with debug symbols or use a debugger to take these steps (for that, see [Debugging Freeswitch](Debugging-Freeswitch.mdx#about))

### Debug for the Impatient

From a bash/shell:

```bash
export TPORT_LOG=1
```

Start FreeSWITCHⓇ (*e.g.* `/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch`)

Press <kbd>F8</kbd>.

This will produce quite of logs ready to be pasted into freeswitch pastebin <http://pastebin.freeswitch.org/> 

To turn this logging off, exit freeswitch and:

```bash
unset TPORT_LOG
```

### Enabling SIP/Sofia Tracing

Stop FreeSWITCHⓇ. At the bash shell prompt enter any subset of the following:

```bash
export SOFIA_DEBUG=9
export NUA_DEBUG=9
export NTA_DEBUG=9
export TPORT_DEBUG=9
export TPORT_LOG=1
```

:::note

If you only want to see the SIP messages then use the `TPORT_LOG` export only.

:::

For the full set of environment variables, see <http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/refdocs/debug%5Flogs.html>

You don't have to rebuild sofia for these to work.

Restart FreeSWITCHⓇ

### Enabling SIP/Sofia Tracing on Windows

* From mailing list post by UV.

In Windows, you need to set those environment variables using `set` instead of `export`. Like this:

```bash
set SOFIA_DEBUG=9
set NUA_DEBUG=9
set SOA_DEBUG=9
set NEA_DEBUG=9
set IPTSEC_DEBUG=9
set NTA_DEBUG=9
set TPORT_DEBUG=9
set TPORT_LOG=1
set TPORT_DUMP=tport_sip.log
set SU_DEBUG=9
```

Then run `freeswitch.exe` in the same process.

### Increase Debug Output

Edit <RepoLink path="conf/vanilla/autoload_configs/console.conf.xml">`console.conf.xml`</RepoLink>:

```xml
<param name="log_event" value="DEBUG"/> 
<param name="all" value="DEBUG"/>
```

Edit <RepoLink path="conf/vanilla/autoload_configs/switch.conf.xml">`switch.conf.xml`</RepoLink> (especially if you have lots of calls, reduce logging)

```xml
<param name="loglevel" value="debug"/>
```

The possible values for the `value` attribute are listed in the table below.

| Numeric Log Level | XML Value Attribute |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `0` | `CONSOLE` |
| `1` | `ALERT` |
| `2` | `CRIT` |
| `3` | `ERR` |
| `4` | `WARNING` |
| `5` | `NOTICE` |
| `6` | `INFO` |
| `7` | `DEBUG` |

You may also use the console API to set debug level on FS console.

```text
freeswitch@de> console loglevel [0-7] (numerical value as above)
```
And you can also set the levels of fsctl.

```text
freeswitch@de> fsctl loglevel [0-7] (numerical value as above)
```

To change the log level in `fs_cli`:

```text
/log [0-7] (numerical value as above)
```

## Colorizing output

In <RepoLink path="conf/vanilla/autoload_configs/console.conf.xml">`console.conf.xml`</RepoLink> uncomment the color mode.

The colors are:

* `ALERT` - Red
* `CRIT` - Red
* `ERROR` - Red
* `WARNING` - Magenta
* `NOTICE` - Cyan
* `INFO` - Green
* `DEBUG` - Yellow

## Enabling libedit

Enable libedit via `--enable-core-libedit-support` argument to the `./configure` script when you build FreeSWITCHⓇ to enable command-line history editing and curses functionality.

## Call Troubles  

1. Check to see what the encoding is, so you know what needs to be debugged. `show channels` on the `fs_cli`.
2. Make a call to the same endpoint, to see if it is related to a short, or long call.
3. Check for any error or warning output in the `fs_cli` during the calls, to see if there is something obvious that FS already knows about.
4. If with the same endpoint you always experience the problem, try to isolate where the issue is.
5. Call `9198` and listen to Tetris to see if the problem is present there.
6. Call `9197` and listen to the mw tone.
7. Call `9196` and test the echo.
8. If steps 5-7 don't show the issue, then the connection between phone to FS is fine.
9. Try other endpoints to see whether it is experienced in all cases.
10. Call `5000`, and call the `888` conference to see whether the issue is present there.
11. Call the endpoint (if it is [PSTN](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1048834)) with a POTS or mobile phone, to see whether it is VoIP related or endpoint related.

You should know where the issue lies after these steps!
