freeswitch@default> console loglevel 7
+OK log level 7 [7]
+OK console log level set to DEBUG
freeswitch@default> sofia global siptrace on
+OK Global siptrace on
```

Run the call/scenario that you are having trouble with, then copy the output to your clipboard.

Visit [Pastebin](http://pastebin.freeswitch.org) and be sure to set the type to "FreeSWITCH" and you may wish to set the expire to one month (see screen shot below) then paste the content into the textarea. Hit "Send" and then copy the resulting url to whom ever is providing you assistance.
