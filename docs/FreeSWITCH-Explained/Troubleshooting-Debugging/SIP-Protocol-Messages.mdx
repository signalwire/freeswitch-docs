## Example: Playback custom error message

  
**Dialplan example**

```xml
<action application="set" data="hangup_on_bridge=true"/>
<action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>
<action application="bridge" data="..."/>
<action application="lua" data="playerror.lua"/>
```

That'll run the lua script after the bridge, but only if the bridge fails.

In the lua script:

**Lua script**

```ruby
cause = session:getVariable("originate_disposition")
if (cause == "USER_BUSY") then
    session:streamFile("ivr/ivr-user_busy.wav");
elseif (cause == "UNALLOCATED_NUMBER") then
    session:streamFile("ivr/ivr-unallocated_number.wav");
elseif (cause == "NO_USER_RESPONSE" or cause=="NO_ANSWER") then
    session:streamFile("ivr/ivr-no_user_response.wav");
else
    session:streamFile("ivr/ivr-please_check_number_try_again.wav");
end
```

See [Hangup\_Causes](./Hangup-Cause-Code-Table.mdx#about) for the full list of causes.

  
Alternatively you can now use [transfer\_on\_fail](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable%5Ftransfer%5Fon%5Ffail "Variable transfer on fail") like this

**Dialplan Example transfer\_on\_fail**

```xml
<action application="set" data="hangup_on_bridge=true"/>
<action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>
<action application="set" data="transfer_on_fail=UNALLOCATED_NUMBER auto_cause xml error"/>
<action application="bridge" data="A..."/>

<action application="bridge" data="B..."/>
```

  
then have the an "Error" context in your dialplan.

**Dialplan Context error**

```xml
<context name="error">
    <extension name="UNALLOCATED_NUMBER" continue="true">
      <condition field="${originate_disposition}" expression="UNALLOCATED_NUMBER" continue="false" break="on-true">
        <action application="playback" data="/usr/local/freeswitch/sounds/NotInService.wav"/>
        <action application="hangup" data="NORMAL_CLEARING"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
</context>
```
