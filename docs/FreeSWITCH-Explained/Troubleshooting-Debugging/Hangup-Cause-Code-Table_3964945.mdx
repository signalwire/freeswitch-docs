# Hangup Cause Code Table 

 

## About

The default code is NORMAL\_CLEARING (if you do not specify one)

The codes are documented in [src/switch\_channel.c](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/master/src/switch%5Fchannel.c#L56) and [SIP Protocol Messages](./SIP-Protocol-Messages_1048971.mdx#about)

IE stands for Information Element

  
## Q.850 to SIP Code Table

The following table describes the mappings implemented by FreeSwitch (see [mod\_sofia.c:hangup\_cause\_to\_sip](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/master/src/mod/endpoints/mod%5Fsofia/mod%5Fsofia.c#L288)). Unspecified causes codes (no value in the "SIP Equiv." column in the table) are translated to SIP "480 Temporarily Unavailable" by FreeSwitch.

The table also contains non-standard codes above 127 (ISUP and ISDN only specify codes up to 127). These codes are used internally to FreeSwitch to indicate other states. (These codes do not map directly to SIP error codes either.) The complete list of SWITCH\_CAUSE\_ codes (switch\_call\_cause\_t) is defined in include/switch\_types.h.

See [ITU-T Q.850 standard](http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.850/) for a formal definition of standard telephony disconnect cause codes for ISDN, and the mapping between Q.931 (DSSS1) and ISUP codes.

See [ITU Q.1912.5](http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.1912.5/) for a formal definition of interoperability between ISUP and SIP, especially section 6.11 which specifies the "Reason" header and gives the mapping of the disconnect cause codes between ISUP and SIP.

Another set of mappings are the Q.SIG / SIP mappings from [RFC 4497](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4497) section 8.4.1\. (Q.SIG is one of many extensions to Q.931 used for PBX-to-PBX signalling on private links.)

In practice it appears that FreeSwitch implements neither Q.1912.5 nor RFC4497.
