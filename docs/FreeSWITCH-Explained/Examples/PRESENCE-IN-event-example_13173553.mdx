## About

The following events can be sent over the [Event Socket](../Modules/mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) to make BLF lights do things. Tested with a snom 360.

### Flash the lamp:

```xml
sendevent PRESENCE_IN
proto: sip
from: 801@example.com
login: 801@example.com
event_type: presence
alt_event_type: dialog
Presence-Call-Direction: outbound
answer-state: early
```

### Turn the lamp on:

```xml
sendevent PRESENCE_IN
proto: sip
from: 801@example.com
login: 801@example.com
event_type: presence
alt_event_type: dialog
Presence-Call-Direction: outbound
