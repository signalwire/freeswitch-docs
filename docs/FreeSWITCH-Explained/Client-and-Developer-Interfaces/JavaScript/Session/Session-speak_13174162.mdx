in cepstral phrase can include SSML tags as well. See [here](http://www.cepstral.com/cgi-bin/support?page=faq&type=ssml) for more info

in cepstral if phrase starts with / it will open a file specified and read its contents instead of a string -- need windows specifics on path information

### Example

```xml
session.speak("cepstral","David","Hello from FreeSwitch");
```

#### with callback

```xml
function my_dtmf_callback(dtmf_str, digits, args)
{
    console_log("debug", "you dialed the following " + dtmf_str + " + digits + "\n");
    return true;
}

session.speak("cepstral", "david", '<break time="500ms"/>Hello this is a test of the break tag', my_dtmf_callback);
```

  
Be sure not to put the name of the callback function in quotes.

#### reading a file

```xml
session.speak("cepstral","David","/etc/passwd");
```
