## V8 Supersedes SpiderMonkey

FreeSWITCH originally used the Mozilla [SpiderMonkey](http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/) JavaScript (ECMAScript) engine. It supports all the standard JavaScript language elements, for example 'for' and 'while' loops, regexps, etc. In addition there are things that are specific to FreeSWITCH which are listed below. You need to have mod\_v8 compiled and installed to take advantage of these functions. Each of those sections is documented below.

From commit b76233266931ca0b53f3bcc589277b972d714216 (January 14'th 2014) in git master, FreeSWITCH has support for the [Google V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) JavaScript (ECMAScript) engine. This is provided from the module [mod\_v8](../../Modules/mod_v8_1048935.mdx#api). In current git master [mod\_v8](../../Modules/mod_v8_1048935.mdx#api) is the default JavaScript engine. mod\_v8 is a drop-in replacement for mod\_spidermonkey, so the old scripts should work as before. There are two differences though, the SpiderMonkey engine has support for built in classes XML and File; these classes are not available in the V8 engine. mod\_v8 provides a different XML interface, you can read more about it here: [Javascript XML](Javascript-Examples/index.mdx#about). mod\_v8 will publish similar functions as the File class, but this is still work in progress so check the status of that functionality.

## Build and Install

mod\_v8 is now built and installed by default.

If for some reason it's not, do the following:

* Uncomment languages/mod\_v8 in modules.conf in your src directory (make it always build and install v8)
* Run 'make mod\_v8-install' to make and install just the v8 module
* Edit conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml in your FreeSWITCH™ install directory to load mod\_v8
* Restart freeswitch

## Execution of a script

There are two methods for script execution, via an API call _jsrun_ and via an application _javascript_. When you use the API a default [Session](Session/index.mdx#methods) object is not created, as there is no call to associate it with. By default, scripts will be loaded from the `FS\_ROOT}/scripts directory`, you may override this by placing a / as the first character in Unix-like systems or a x:\\ in Windows systems as the script name.

### Application

From the [Dialplan](../../Dialplan/XML-Dialplan/index.mdx#about), you simply call it as an application similar to:

```shell
<action application="javascript" data="/path/to/some/script.js"/>
```

If you need to pass arguments into to the javascript application, they can be passed in as a single string to the variable "argv" by doing the following:

```shell
<action application="javascript" data="/path/to/some/script.js $1"/>
```

### API

At the FreeSWITCH™ console, or some other application/interface execute the jsrun call with the script name as its argument.

```shell
jsrun /path/to/some/script.js
```

## FAQ

### Passing variables to my JavaScript

On console:

```shell
  jsrun script.js arg1 arg2 ...
```

These can be accessed as argv\[0\], argv\[1\],.. in the script

In dialplan

**Dialplan JS example**

```xml
  <extension ...>
    <condition ...>
       <action application="javascript" data="script.js ${caller_id_number}"/>
     </condition>
   </extension>
```

If you're running the script as an application for originate command:

**JS originate examples**

```js
//single argument
   originate sofia/internal/1000 &javascript(script.js arg1)          
 
//multiple arguments
   originate sofia/internal/1000 '&javascript(script.js arg1 arg2)'   
```

### How can I print stuff inside my JavaScript

```javascript
console_log("notice","<Whatever you need to print>");
```
