All the text below was last edited in 2007, it is therefore likely out-of-date, inaccurate and in dire need of a refresh

##   
Properties

* socketaddr - STRING host host:ip eg "localhost:8084"
* session - SESSION OBJECT the current session
* faxDetect - BOOLEAN state of fax CNG detection
* faxFilePrefix - STRING directory prefix to the fax (for tx or rx)
* faxFile - STRING the filename in faxFilePrefix of the fax
* gotFax - BOOLEAN whether or not a fax was received

## Methods

* stopFaxDetect - stops fax CNG detection, called automatically when receiving a fax
* startFaxDetect - starts fax CNG detection
* getFaxFile - returns a STRING of the full path to the fax file
* rxFax - receives a fax
* txFax - transmits a fax
* fax2pdf - converts a fax tiff into a pdf, the fax object will point to that pdf from then on

## Constructor

```xml
fax(session,socketaddr [, faxFilePrefix [, faxFile]])
```

Example:

```xml
var f = new fax(session,"localhost:8084","/tmp","myfax.tiff");
```

The last 2 arguments are optional and if not specified will be "/tmp" and the "&lt;uuid>.tiff" where &lt;uuid> is replaced by the current uuid of the call in progress.
