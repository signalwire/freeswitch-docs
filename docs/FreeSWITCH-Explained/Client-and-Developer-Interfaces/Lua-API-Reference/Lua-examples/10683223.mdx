# Lua: send SMS via Flowroute when voicemail is received 

 

Brought to you by Steven Schoch on the FreeSwitch mailing list in June 2016.

**Assuming Lua is already installed on your system and configured with FreeSwitch.** 

If you don't have an account with flowroute.com, sign up and enable the developer account needed. At the current time, this can be found under Preferences > API control.

You may need to visit [Here](https://developer.flowroute.com/) to setup the credentials. You will also need to purchase a DID from Flowroute so you can actually send SMS messages.

Here's the script that does the actual processing. As you may have guessed, load this to **/usr/local/freeswitch/scripts** and read below for the rest of the configuration needed. Add your user and password in the url section.

**voicemail-event.lua**

```bash
--[[
     This script is called by configuration in autoload_configs/lua.conf.xml.
     It is called on a "vm:maintenance" event.
]]

-- The following is specifc to the Flowroute SMS API,
-- documented at https://developer.flowroute.com/docs/messaging
url = "https://user:password@api.flowroute.com/v2/messages"

action = event:getHeader("VM-Action")
if action ~= "leave-message" then return end
user = event:getHeader("VM-User")
domain = event:getHeader("VM-Domain")
caller_id_name = event:getHeader("VM-Caller-ID-Name")
caller_id_number = event:getHeader("VM-Caller-ID-Number")
--[[ We don't care about these:
file_path = event:getHeader("VM-File-Path")
flags = event:getHeader("VM-Flags")
folder = event:getHeader("VM-Folder")
uuid = event:getHeader("VM-UUID")
--]]
message_len = event:getHeader("VM-Message-Len")
timestamp = event:getHeader("VM-Timestamp")
api = freeswitch.API();
from = api:execute("user_data", user .. "@" .. domain ..  " var outbound_caller_id_number")
to = api:execute("user_data", user .. "@" .. domain .. " param vm-notify-sms")
if to == "" then return end

if caller_id_name == ''
        or caller_id_name == 'UNKNOWN'
        or caller_id_name == 'UNASSIGNED'
        or caller_id_name == 'WIRELESS CALLER'
        or caller_id_name == 'TOLL FREE CALL'
        or caller_id_name == 'Anonymous'
        or caller_id_name == 'Unavailable'
        then caller_id_name = nil end
if caller_id_number == ''
        then caller_id_number = nil end
message = "Voicemail "
if caller_id_name
        then message = message .. "from " .. caller_id_name .. " (" ..  caller_id_number .. ")"
        elseif caller_id_number
        then message = message .. "from " .. caller_id_number end
message = message .. " at " .. os.date("%a %H:%M", timestamp)
message = message .. " length " .. message_len .. " seconds"
message = message .. " to box " .. user
message = message .. "."
-- Add JSON string escapes to the message
message = string.gsub(message, "([\\\"'])", "\\%1")
-- Send the text
data = '{ "to": "' .. to .. '", "from": "' .. from .. '", "body": "' .. message .. '"}'
api:execute("curl", url .. " content-type application/json post '" .. data .. "'")
```

Edit **/usr/src/freeswitch/modules.conf** and enable applications/curl:

**modules.conf**

```bash
applications/mod_curl
```

Compile FreeSwitch as usual:

**Build FreeSWITCH**

```bash
make
make install
# Or if you're following master:
make current
```

Now you will need to have mod\_curl load when you start FreeSwitch. Edit **/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml:** 

**modules.conf.xml:**

```bash
<load module="mod_curl"/>
```

Uncomment mod\_curl and make it look like the above.

Add the line below to your extension, such as **/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/directory/default/1001.xml**:

**1001.xml**

```bash
<param name="vm-notify-sms" value="1202478xxxx"/>
```

Be sure to add this within the \<params> tag and not \<variables>.

This will be the telephone number where you want to receive the alert. Replace it with a legitimate phone number.

In the same file, you will need to consider adding your Flowroute number that you purchased. You must send from a Flowroute phone number that's associated with your account.

**Caller ID**

```bash
<variable name="outbound_caller_id_number" value="1468856xxxx"/>
```

You can also edit /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/vars.xml and have a global caller ID, if desired.

Add this line to **/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/lua.conf.xml**:

**lua.conf.xml**

```bash
<hook event="CUSTOM" subclass="vm::maintenance" script="voicemail-event.lua"/>
```

Ensure this is somewhere between the beginning and ending \<settings> tags.

**TEST:**

fs\_cli to the Freeswitch server, make a call and look for something like this after the voicemail is processed:

2016-07-01 04:48:02.930006 \[DEBUG\] mod\_lua.cpp:459 lua event hook: execute 'voicemail-event.lua'

Check the device the SMS was sent to and you'll see a message like the following:

Voicemail from Extension 1000 (1000) at Fri 04:48 length 6 seconds to box 1001.
