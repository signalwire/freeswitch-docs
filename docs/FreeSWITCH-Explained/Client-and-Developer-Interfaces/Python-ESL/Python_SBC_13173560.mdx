## PySBC: A Session Border Controller in Python

FreeSWITCH is not a pure Session Border Controller (SBC). To have a truly scaleable FreeSWITCH cluster with load balancing, and failover, you need a lightweight, high-performance SBC cluster in front of FreeSWITCH Media Servers that handle the media proxy.

### My Plans

SBC written in Python â€” Using FreeSWITCH ESL libs and Twisted, PySBC is a server written in Python that tracks call volume in each server using ESL. Then, every SIP request PySBC receives, it checks for the lowest loaded server, and responds to the request with a 302 Redirect to that server.

BAM! SBC

Redundancy handled with Heartbeat on 2x of these servers

### Beginning Code

```py
#NOTE THIS CODE IS INCOMPLETE! It will run, but not without runtime errors.
