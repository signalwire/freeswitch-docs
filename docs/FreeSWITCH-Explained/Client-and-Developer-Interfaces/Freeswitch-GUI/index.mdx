# Freeswitch GUI 

 

## About

FreeSWITCH GUI can use XML-RPC, ESL, Erlang and several communication methods to communicate with FreeSWITCH. The powerful method is the useful ESL library that is translated to several languages, including Perl, Lua, Python, Ruby, .NET and others.

There are several graphical user interfaces available for FreeSWITCH. A few are listed below. These can assist in managing XML configuration files and FreeSWITCH operations themselves. All of them sit on top of a FreeSWITCH installation (so you should probably still familiarize yourself with the instructions above).

  
## Open Source GUI Solutions for FreeSWITCH

### Blue.box

blue.box is a modular, highly scalable, object-oriented, multi-platform, multi-OS web interface for managing FreeSWITCH. It was created by the developer of the FreeSWITCH mod\_nibblebill module. The platform allows management of the entire FreeSWITCH system via a simple, friendly GUI and requires no knowledge of the underlying XML configuration structures. Great care has been taken to allow for future expansion via modules and plug-ins.

Note that despite the support of multiple switching engines, the project has a heavy focus on the FreeSWITCH project and provides FreeSWITCH-only modules to support advanced functionality in FreeSWITCH.

### FusionPBX

FusionPBX is a feature rich, multi-platform, highly customizable, scalable and fast web interface to manage FreeSWITCH as a PBX or as a voice SWITCH. The project started as the FreeSWITCH package on pfSense. Development was done to make it work with multiple operating systems this includes various version of Linux, BSD, Windows, Mac OS X, and others. The data storage was moved from pfSense's XML data storage to PHP Data Objects (PDO) which provides ability to use SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL and other data storage engines. It can use any web server that supports PHP5 this includes Apache, Lighttpd, nginx, IIS and many others.

FusionPBX currently has 48 additional modules (aka packages) that provide a great deal of functionality. Some examples of the functionality include but art not limited to active calls, active extensions, interactive conference interface, interactive queues, very detailed call records with XML CDR, auto phone provisioning, IVR menu for auto attendant features, hunt groups, call forward, DISA, time conditions, dialplan editor, sip gateway manager, extension management, user management, contact management, content and menu manager and more. Development is active. To learn more use the links below.

### FreePyBX

FreePyBX is an MPL 2.0 opensource licensed feature-rich GUI implementation for FreeSWITCH. User-friendly intuitive interface allows your customers to enjoy all of the features and stability of very expensive proprietary software for free. It was written in Python with the Pylons framework, the call control is mostly Lua, but the directory, configuration, and dialplan are also XML cURL. It is an ITSP multi-tenant system supporting many features like call center queues, click-to-call, text-to-speech and much more. Some of the technologies that it utilizes are dojo, ajax, and has interfaces to JSON that can easly be used for an API for third-party, cloud api, or legacy systems and rdbms'. The code is easy to follow and was written very modular to allow easy integration with third-party modules and custom development. An excellent choice for an ITSP telephony framework.

It utilizes a single profile with a single IP and port--perfect for a hosted PBX ITSP provider.

The development is very active and currently only supports FreeSWITCH with no plans to port to other switches.

### FreeSWITCHConfig

Web-based .Net program designed to configure/control a freeswitch server.

It allows for creation of extensions, setting up internal and external sip gateways and a fair bit of basic routing. It is expandable by implementing IModule classes to create site based modules for new routing methods, security, whatever features are desired. The project is looking for skilled C# or javascript developers to assist with the development.
