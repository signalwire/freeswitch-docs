## Introduction

RTCP - [RTP Control Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP%5FControl%5FProtocol) \- provides out-of-band statistics and control information for an RTP session. Only the Sender Report (SR) messages are sent by FreeSWITCH.

## Discussion

RTCP can be configured on a per-session basis or for the entire SIP profile. Its transmission intervals can be set from between 100 ms to 5000 ms.

## Per Session

Use the **rtcp\_audio\_interval\_msec** and **rtcp\_video\_internal\_msec** channel variables.

```xml
<!-- enables rtcp to be sent every 5 secs
---  Include this line in the dialplan before you bridge
---  Be aware that there is resource overhead. So stress
---  test before you deploy          -->

<action application="set" data="rtcp_audio_interval_msec=5000"/>
```

##   
Entire Profile

Set these params in the SIP profile:

```xml
 <!-- enable rtcp on every channel also can be done per leg basis 
      with rtcp_audio_interval_msec variable set to passthru to pass 
      it across a call -->
 <param name="rtcp-audio-interval-msec" value="5000"/>
 <param name="rtcp-video-interval-msec" value="5000"/>
```
