## About

Execute an application as soon as you get a T.38 invite. This variable is similar to execute\_on\_answer.   
You can run t38\_gateway or rxfax etc when you get a T.38 re-invite but no CNG tone, or you want to ignore the tone and only react when getting a T.38 re-invite.

## **Usage:** 

Need an example.
