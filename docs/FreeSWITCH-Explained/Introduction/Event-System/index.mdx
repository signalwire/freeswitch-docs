## 0. About {#about}

FreeSWITCH is event-driven; it responds to and emits events. [Events](./Events_32178330.mdx#0-about) are the result of any activity happening on the system, and are generated by the [core and modules of FreeSWITCH](../index.mdx#architecture), and by external sources. The event system is also what makes it possible to build [event socket](../Glossary.mdx#event-socket) applications.

You can quickly see the event system in action in [fs\_cli](../../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx) :

```xml
$ fs_cli
freeswitch@your_host> /event ALL
```

All you need to do now is to start making calls, issue commands, or just wait, and the events will start pouring in.

For a comprehensive list of events, see [Event List](./Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat).

## 1\. Events

The event system allows external software programs to act as listeners regarding. Almost everything that happens within the FreeSWITCH system causes some sort of **event message** to be generated. These events can be watched by external entities. This is similar to the publish/subscribe (or "pub-sub") system used by common message queuing software solutions, although it is specifically tailored for FreeSWITCH events.

The event system is bi-directional: In addition to allowing external programs to listen to events, external programs can also send events to FreeSWITCH. You can send and/or receive events in real time from your own programs. This combination allows you to use FreeSWITCH in almost any way you can imagine.
