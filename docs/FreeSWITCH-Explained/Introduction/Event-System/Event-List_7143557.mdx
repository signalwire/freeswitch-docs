# Event List 

 

## 0\. About

All the [events](./Events_32178330.mdx#0-about) that can be handled by FreeSWITCH's [event system](./index.mdx#0-about).

The current up-to-date list of events can be found in [src/switch\_event.c](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/master/src/switch%5Fevent.c) in a char array called `EVENT_NAMES`.

## 1\. Channel events

The channel events are event types/classes that can be used to monitor which calls come into an extension, and what states are the calls currently in.

Channel events can carry additional information for the protocol (i.e. SIP) used to transport the call. This information can safely be ignored, you don't have to use it to be able to track calls.

The minimum information sent for channel events (plus the headers in **0.1 Minimum event information**):

```xml
Channel-State: CS_NEW
Channel-State-Number: 0
Channel-Name: sofia/192.168.0.58/jonas%40192.168.0.58%3A5060
```

Channel states

The state the channel can be in. Indicated by the **`Channel-State`** and **`Channel-State-Number`**, which are sent with all CHANNEL events.

See [Channel States](../../Dialplan/Channel-States_7144639.mdx#0-about) for the complete list.

### 1.1 `CHANNEL_CALLSTATE` event

TODO

What is the difference between CHANNEL\_CALLSTATE and CHANNEL\_STATE? (click to expand)

There seems to be a correspondence between channel states and `CHANNEL_*STATE` events. For example, only saw `CHANNEL_CALLSTATE` with channel states `RINGING` and `HANGUP`, and `CHANNEL_STATE` with the rest.

Also corroborated by a mailing list thread: \<https://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2012-February/080189.html>, and the answer may lies in [switch\_core\_state\_machine.c](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/master/src/switch%5Fcore%5Fstate%5Fmachine.c).

[Creating a New Endpoint: Lifecycle of a Session](../../Community/Contributing-Code/Creating-New-Modules/9634354.mdx#0-about) page also goes into the FreeSWITCH state machine.

What is the relation between CHANNEL\_CALLSTATE and CHANNEL\_STATE events, and Channel-State and Channel-Call-State headers? (click to expand)

The empty lines denote the boundaries between different events. Made a test call (that hasn't been answered, only routed by an extension), and the resulting events have been filtered in Vim using `/"Channel-State"\|"Channel-Call-State"\|^$\|CHANNEL_CALLSTATE\|CHANNEL_STATE` 

The UML diagram in [Life Cycle of a Call](../Life-Cycle-of-a-Call.mdx#0-about) and the dump below should be helpful to decipher this. See [attachment](/attachments/7143557/32178221.html) for a diff between two `CHANNEL_STATE` event, one in `CS_ROUTING` and one in `CS_EXECUTE` state (there's very little difference).

### 1.8 `CHANNEL_EXECUTE` event

This event indicates that the PBX is doing something with the call. (Typically looking in the dial plan).

Document Application\* headers

TODO 

Found usage examples in [IVR using mod\_erlang\_event](../../Modules/mod-erlang-event/IVR-using-mod_erlang_event_30867811.mdx#how), but couldn't find the `Application*` headers documented anywhere. [mod\_event\_socket](../../Modules/mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl)'s `sendmsg` section only mentions the `Application-UUID` header:

If you would like to correlate the [CHANNEL\_EXECUTE](Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) and [CHANNEL\_EXECUTE\_COMPLETE](Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) events that are generated when the command you send using sendmsg is executed you can add an Event-UUID header with a UUID you specify. In the corresponding events, the UUID will be in the Application-UUID header. If you do not specify an Event-UUID, Freeswitch will generate a UUID for the Application-UUID.

Example:

Event-UUID: 22075ce5-b67b-4f04-a6dd-1726ec14c8bf

The `Application*` headers seem to be tightly coupled with [CHANNEL\_EXECUTE](Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) and [CHANNEL\_EXECUTE\_COMPLETE](Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) headers:

### 1.9 `CHANNEL_EXECUTE_COMPLETE` event

This event is emitted when a dialplan application (started with `sendmsg` or `send` (?)) finished running.

### 1.11 `CHANNEL_UNBRIDGE` event

A bridge has been terminated. The call itself will most probably be terminated since bridges exist during a call's lifespan.

TODO Check the example below for validity (for example, semicolons should be colons).

### 1.18 `CHANNEL_HOLD` event

Triggers when a channel is put on hold either by using `uuid_hold` (see [mod\_commands](../../Modules/mod_commands_1966741.mdx#--)) or receiving SDP with `a=readonly`.

**CHANNEL\_HOLD example**

```xml
Event-Name: CHANNEL_HOLD
.
.
Channel-Call-State: HELD
.
.
```

### 1.19 `CHANNEL_UNHOLD` event

triggers after uuid\_hold off \<uuid> or receiving INVITE SDP with a=sendrecv

**CHANNEL\_UNHOLD example**

```xml
Event-Name: CHANNEL_UNHOLD
.
.
Channel-Call-State: ACTIVE
.
.
```

### 1.20 `CHANNEL_ORIGINATE` event

Channel originate events are fired as soon as an originate (or bridge) completes.

### 1.21 `CHANNEL_UUID` event

This event indicates the `Unique-ID` of a channel has changed. The original ID will be reported by `Old-Unique-ID`.

This event will happen when you use the `origination_uuid` parameter of commands `originate and ` `bridge` (see [mod\_commands](../../Modules/mod_commands_1966741.mdx#--)).

### BACKGROUND_JOB

Use this to receive an event when a job started with the bgapi call finishes. The BACKGROUND\_JOB event will contain a Job-UUID that matches up with Job-UUID returned by the server when bgapi is called.

The following examples are in the context of an [mod\_event\_socket](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event%5FSocket "Event Socket") client.

### STARTUP

### PUBLISH

### UNPUBLISH

### TALK

Triggered when speech is detected on channel. Needs parameter "vad" to be set in the sip profile. e.g:

You also need to set some channel variables to make this work:

\<action application="export" data="fire_talk_events=true"/>
\<action application="export" data="fire_not_talk_events=true"/>
