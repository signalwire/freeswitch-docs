# Introduction

### About
  
In this Introduction we provide a brief overview of FreeSWITCH in laymen's terms. We will then introduce all the key concepts in FreeSWITCH, and guide you on how to navigate the documentation. By following this introduction, you should be able to setup a basic deployment of FreeSWITCH in no time. Should you decide to dig deeper, and get familiar with more advanced features, we provide the links where you can find that too. At the end we will also provide a walk-through of the [default configuration](../Configuration/Default-Configuration_6587388.mdx#mod_vp8), so that you can get a hands-on tutorial, and most commonly used features.  

### What is FreeSWITCH?

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a versatile software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. From a Raspberry PI to a multi-core server, FreeSWITCH can unlock the telecommunications potential of any device. Combined with our hosted cloud platform, SignalWire, FreeSWITCH can interconnect with the outside world and scale to any size. (Visit <https://signalwire.com> for more info)

FreeSWITCH can handle voice, video and text communications from an IP Network ([VoIP](Glossary.mdx#voip)) and the [PSTN](Glossary.mdx#pstn) (i.e., regular landlines). FreeSWITCH supports all popular [VoIP](Glossary.mdx#voip) protocols as well as interfacing with [PRIs](Glossary.mdx#pri). For a full listing of supported protocols, see the [Endpoints ](./Endpoints_15696294.mdx#about)page.

Some common capacities, that FreeSWITCH is used for, include

* [PBX](Glossary.mdx#pbx) (Office phone system)
* [Class 5 Softswitch](Glossary.mdx#softswitch) (Telephone carrier)
* Application server such as Voicemail, conferencing, IVR
* [Softphone](Glossary.mdx#softphone)

  
This list is by no means comprehensive. FreeSWITCH is extremely flexible, and can be used in any way you can imagine.

The [default configuration](../Configuration/Default-Configuration_6587388.mdx#mod_vp8) showcases a full-featured [PBX](Glossary.mdx#pbx) with many applications. 

### Where can I run FreeSWITCH?

At it's core, FreeSWITCH is a library which can be [embedded](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Embedding-FreeSWITCH/index.mdx#php) in your application on any device. However, more commonly, it is built to run as a [background process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon%5F%28computing%29) (daemon in UNIX or Linux systems, service on Windows platforms). When you run FreeSWITCH as a daemon, you can use the [CLI ](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx#or)to interact with FreeSWITCH.

FreeSWITCH can run on many Platforms, including Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, Solaris, and even Windows.

If you don't want to operate your own server, the corporate sponsor of FreeSWITCH, [SignalWire](https://signalwire.com), provides cloud-hosted FreeSWITCH services from dedicated FreeSWITCH servers to auto-scaling cloud-hosted services.

 Although FreeSWITCH can run on many Linux distributions, such Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora and RHEL, our preferred distribution is Debian, because we have worked out all dependencies on Debian so you can have a smooth installation and startup. Debian is also what the FreeSWITCH developers use, therefore have the most experience with. If you run on other distributions, you might have a hard time getting all dependencies right.

See [Release Notes](../Release-Notes/index.mdx#-freeswitch--release-notes-) and [Installation](../Installation/index.mdx#about) instructions for the latest supported platforms.

Hardware requirements depend on how you will use FreeSWITCH. FreeSWITCH can run on hardware as small as a Raspberry Pi, and can scale up to powerful data center servers with dozens of CPU cores. FreeSWITCH is capable of handling thousands of concurrent phone calls, depending on what hardware you have and which applications you are using.

For more information about hardware requirements see [Release Notes](../Release-Notes/index.mdx#-freeswitch--release-notes-) and [Performance Testing and Configurations](../Configuration/Performance-Testing-and-Configurations/index.mdx). 

### Architecture

When designing FreeSWITCH the goal was to have the following properties:

  
* **Extensibility** \- Allowing new features to be added easily.
* **Flexibility** \- Users should be able to pick and choose which functionalities are enabled, while also allowing them to replace parts of the system with different implementations
* **Scalability** \- FreeSWITCH can be run on systems as small as an embedded [softphone](Glossary.mdx#softphone) or as big as a cluster of full-blown carrier switches.
* **Stability** \- Problems with one feature should not bring down the whole system.

To accomplish these goals FreeSWITCH is built using a **modular system**:

* There is a small **core** that provides the base system used by all modules, however most of the functionalities are not implemented in the core itself,
* but rather in **standalone modules** that are not dependent on each other.

When you install FreeSWITCH with the [default configuration](../Configuration/Default-Configuration_6587388.mdx#mod_vp8), the modules that are required for most common scenarios are enabled. We will see later in the [configuration](../Modules/XML-Modules-Configuration_13173211.mdx#xml-modules-configuration) section how to enable/disable modules.

The [modules](../Modules/index.mdx#about) are grouped by the type of functionality they provide. We will now explore the types of modules, and what functionality is provided by each.

Some of the included loggers are [console](../Modules/mod_console_1048950.mdx#about) and [log file](../Modules/mod_logfile_1048990.mdx#about). [xml\_cdr ](../Modules/mod_xml_cdr_6587377.mdx#faq)is another commonly used logger to output call detail records.                                                                                                             |

There a few more types of modules, but these are the common ones. For a listing of common module see the [Modules ](../Modules/index.mdx#about)page. If you require some functionality that's not provided by one of the existing modules, you can [write your own module](../Community/Contributing-Code/Creating-New-Modules/index.mdx#about). Modules can be written in many popular programming languages. See the [developer documentation](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Developer-Documentation_13173044.mdx#resources) for more information.

### API

Many modules also have API commands that can be issued from the command line, script or sent from a remote computer via the event socket. What the API commands can do are up to each individual module, but some common functionalities include returning status information (such as how many listeners are in a conference) or control the currently running application (such as pausing a file being played) There are hundreds of APIs available from the different modules. In the command line you can type show api to see all APIs based on the modules that are loaded.

There are also API commands provided by the core, these are in the [Commands](../Modules/mod_commands_1966741.mdx#--) module.

## Leveraging SignalWire for Enhanced Functionality

While FreeSWITCH provides a robust and flexible telecommunication platform, you may find that some challenges require advanced, cloud-based solutions or require additional resources to implement. In such cases, consider leveraging SignalWire's cloud services to enhance your FreeSWITCH experience.

**Why would I use SignalWire?**

**AI:** Connect your voice application and other communications systems to a SignalWire AI Agent that can speak back and forth with users and collect information and perform actions such as forwarding calls, looking up information, or sending information. 

**Full Stack APIs and SDKs:** Fully customizable AI, Voice, Video, SMS, and Fax APIs that can be used alone or on top of your FreeSWITCH. 

**No Code Options:** Speed up development time with no code call flow tools that automatically create SWML script so you always have the option to customize. 

**FreeSWITCH Compatibility:** SignalWire offers APIs that are fully compatible with FreeSWITCH, enabling seamless integration.

**Scalability:** Whether you're running a small operation or a large-scale call center, SignalWire's cloud infrastructure can easily adapt to your needs, without the need for heavy upfront investment.

**Enhanced Features:** From real-time video to text messaging capabilities, SignalWire provides a broader range of communication tools that can enrich your FreeSWITCH applications.

**Reduced Latency:** With data centers globally, SignalWire's services are optimized for low latency, which is crucial for real-time communication applications.

**Expert Support:** Should you encounter any challenges, SignalWire offers expert technical support to guide you through.
