| In my understanding, this is **_Life Cycle for a Channel_** ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by livem at Jul 28, 2020 01:57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| I think the title is appropriate because the flow chart does shows the life cycles of both legs of a call, from start to finish, which is basically a call. In CS\_NEW, the A leg channel is created, and in CS\_EXECUTE (depending on the dialplan instructions) a B leg channel will also be created. Could be wrong. ![](/images/icons/contenttypes/comment_16.png) Posted by toraritte at Aug 03, 2020 09:02 |
