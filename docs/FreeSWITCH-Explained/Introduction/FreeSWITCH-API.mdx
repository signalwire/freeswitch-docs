# FreeSWITCH API 

 

The public FreeSWITCH API consists of all the commands that can be issued to FreeSWITCH via

* its console, [fs\_cli](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx#or),
* the [event socket interface](Glossary.mdx#event-socket), and
* scripting interfaces.

The set of available commands is dependent on which modules are loaded. The authoritative set of commands for your installation is the union of the sets of commands registered by each module.

To see a list of available API commands simply type `**help**` or `**show api**` at the [CLI](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx#or).

TODO Add link to "scripting interfaces". (Is there a general description about it? And one that also mentions SWIG?)

TODO This API definition is taken from [mod\_commands](../Modules/mod_commands_1966741.mdx#--), but not sure if it is completely accurate.
