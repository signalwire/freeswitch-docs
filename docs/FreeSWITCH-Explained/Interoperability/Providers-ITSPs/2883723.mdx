* Inbound only
* We do not register, they just send right to the public dialplan
* In their web config you must point to your server, port 5080
* domain: [freeswitch.org](http://freeswitch.org):5080 (your server, If you did not change vars.xml this will be IP:PORT)
* And for sip number in the web config you can decide on a sip number people can call you at
* I will use 5150 as my sip number
* then in dialplan/public.xml (or an included file):

```xml
<include>
  <extension name="IPKALL">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^5150$">
      <action application="set" data="domain_name=freeswitch.org"/>
      <action application="transfer" data="1001 XML default"/>
    </condition>
  </extension>
</include> 
```
