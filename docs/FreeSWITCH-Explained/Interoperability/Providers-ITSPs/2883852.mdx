_Note_ \- this guide is written by staff at [SureVoIP](http://www.surevoip.co.uk/). If you get stuck, require consultancy or just need any form of help please [contact us](http://www.surevoip.co.uk/contact-surevoip).

[SureVoIP](http://www.surevoip.co.uk/) is an Ofcom regulated Internet Telephony Service Provider supplying business VoIP products and services based in Scotland, UK.

[SureVoIP](http://www.surevoip.co.uk/) can do SIP registration and can send your incoming calls to your registered IP address. Inbound calls can also be delivered to an IP address and port that you control via your control panel.

Outgoing calls can be authenticated via your registration or you can just authenticate when challenged. If you wish to be authenticated using a combination of IP address and caller ID number, you just need to ask.

An example gateway may look like:

  
```xml
<include>
  <gateway name="surevoip">
    <param name="username" value="[my SureVoIP account number]"/>
  <!--/// account password required by freeswitch but will be ignored if authenticating by IP ///-->
    <param name="password" value="pass"/> 

  <!-- proxy name depends on method for authentication -->
    <param name="proxy" value="XXXX.surevoip.co.uk"/>
    <param name="register" value="true"/>

  <!--send an options ping every x seconds, failure will unregister and/or mark it down-->
    <param name="ping" value="60"/>
  </gateway>
</include>
```

  
Inbound routing in _dialplan/public/10\_surevoip.xml_ is then:

```xml
<include>
  <extension name="inbound_surevoip">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^([my SureVoIP phone number])$">
      <action application="set" data="domain_name=$${domain}"/>
      <!-- Our main incoming greeting extension is called 'frontdoor' -->
      <action application="transfer" data="frontdoor XML default"/>
    </condition>
  </extension>
</include>
```

  
For outgoing calls:

```xml
<include>
  <extension name="outgoing">      
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^9([0-9]+)$">
     <!-- effective_caller_id can be set if authenticating by IP and caller ID --> 
     <action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=[my SureVoIP phone number]" />
      <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/surevoip/$1" />
    </condition>
  </extension>
</include>
```

  
A surevoip.xml gateway file which could be used for authentication by IP and Caller ID:

  
```xml
<include>
    <gateway name="surevoip">
      <param name="username" value="[default CID number required to be presented]"/>
      <param name="password" value="nopassword"/>
      <param name="proxy" value="XXXX.surevoip.co.uk"/>
      <param name="expire-seconds" value="2400"/>
      <param name="register" value="false"/>
      <param name="retry-seconds" value="60"/>
      <param name="ping" value="60"/>
      <param name="context" value="public"/>
      <param name="caller-id-in-from" value="true"/>
    </gateway>
  </include> 
```
