```xml
<include>
  <gateway name="did.voip.les.net">
    <param name="username" value="xxxxxxx"/>
    <param name="from-user" value="xxxxxxx"/>
    <param name="realm" value="did.voip.les.net"/>
    <param name="password" value="secret"/>
    <param name="extension-in-contact" value="true"/> <!-- Needed otherwise les.net refuses the call -->
    <param name="caller-id-in-from" value="true"/>
  </gateway>
</include> 
```

**NOTE:** If you don't have extension-in-contact set to true, then freeswitch will send "gw+gatewayname" in the Contact header. [Les.net](http://Les.net) refuses all calls which do not have the trunk name in the Contact header.

The above instructions did not work for me. When I tried to dial a phone number, I always heard a recording from [les.net](http://les.net) that started: "You have reached a [les.net](http://les.net) number that is currently not in service..."

For FreeSWITCH v1.0.4, all I had to do was edit the default\_provider\* parameters in vars.xml. Those parameters are used by conf/directory/default/[example.com](http://example.com).xml.

The above instructions did work for me, with the key being the "extension-in-contact" as mentioned. If you have a problem with cached info, simply create a new [les.net](http://les.net) peer and re-configure everything against the new peer.
