I assume you have the following setup:

* A FreeSWITCH-Server with public IP 1.2.3.4
* Some Numbers like 012 3456 xx registered, where "xx" are extension like 00,01,02...
* Some clients for these extensions

### Inbound calling

To receive calls from the external side, just set up the dialplan accordingly:

```xml
<include>
        <extension>
                <condition field="destination_number" expression="^0123456(\d{2})$">
                        <action application="set" data="call_timeout=20" />
                        <action application="bridge" data="user/$1" />
                        <action application="answer" />
                        <action application="voicemail" data="default $${domain} $1" />
                </condition>
        </extension>
</include>
```

To have this work, you should give your local phones the account names "00","01", "02", etc.

### Outbound calling

To allow your local phones to make outgoing calls, you need to set up a gateway (I did in conf/sip\_profiles/external/netvoip.xml) like following:

```xml
<include>
        <gateway name="siptrunk.netvoip.ch">
                <param name="username" value="004112345600" />
                <param name="from-user" value="004112345600" />
                <param name="password" value="" />
                <param name="realm" value="siptrunk.netvoip.ch" />
                <param name="register" value="false" />
        </gateway>
</include>
```

Please note: NetVoIP may tell you at some point, you should use numbers like 012345600 or 04112345600 - ignore it, use 0041.. Additionally, make sure you have your local users set their caller-id correctly.

```xml
<variable name="effective_caller_id_number" value="0041123456xx" /> 
```

Set up the outgoing dialplan like this:

```xml
<include>
        <extension name="Outbound call">
                <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d{5,})$">
                        <action application="set" data="effective_callerid_number=004112345600" />
                        <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/siptrunk.netvoip.ch/$1" />
                </condition>
        </extension>
</include> 
```
