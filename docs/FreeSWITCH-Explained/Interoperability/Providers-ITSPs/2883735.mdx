Both DID and outgoing calls work.

```xml
<include>
  <gateway name="ivox">
    <param name="username" value="YOURPHONENUMBER"/>
    <param name="from-domain" value="ivox.net.au"/>
    <param name="password" value="YOURPASSWORD"/>
    <param name="extension" value="YOURPHONENUMBER"/>
    <param name="realm" value="ivox.net.au"/>
    <param name="proxy" value="sip.ivox.net.au"/>
    <param name="register" value="true"/>
  </gateway>
</include>
```

## For outbound calls to work

The crucial thing you need to do if you want to place calls is that you must set one variable in your outbound dialplan:

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=***your number***"/>
```

You will need these in every dialplan entry that uses this gateway.

The reason for this is that ivox will reject any call that comes to it from anywhere other than the callerid that is registered with them. By default, freeswitch will send the caller id of your extension with the outgoing call, therefore ivox will reject the call. By setting these variables you override that default behaviour and ivox sees what it wants to see.

  
A more elegant way to achieve this is to set the following in your extension definitions:

```xml
<variable name="outbound_caller_id_number" value="***your number***"/>
```

And then in your outbound dialplan set:

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=${outbound_caller_id_number}"/> 
```
