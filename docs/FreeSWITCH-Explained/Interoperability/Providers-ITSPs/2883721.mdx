Both DID and outgoing calls work. However, in order for the outgoing calls to work one must set From: "XXXXXXXXXX". That does not seem to be achievable with the gateway params/vars (at least I could not find the way), so dialplans need to set some vars.

  
For v.1.2.x:

```xml
  ...
    <action application="export" data="effective_caller_id_name=XXXXXXXXXX" />
    <action application="export" data="effective_caller_id_number=XXXXXXXXXX" />
    <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/Internode/$1" />
    ...
```

For v.1.0.6:;

```xml
 ...
    <action application="export" data="sip_cid_type=none" />
    <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/Internode/$1" />
    ...
```

It is possible that only one is enough.

I tried playing with gateway caller-id-in-from without any success.
