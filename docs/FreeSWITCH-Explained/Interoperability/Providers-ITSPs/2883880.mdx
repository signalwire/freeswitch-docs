## Voicepulse Warning

**WARNING!!!** Recent changes (Sep 2008) in VoicePulse have limited connect03 to only IAX termination. Please remove any entries that you may have reflecting the gateway below from your dialplan as it will most likely answer the call and play a message saying something to the effect of "Your call could not be completed as dialed because we changed our production environment in an effort to demonstrate what bad engineering is all about. BAD is an acronym for Broken As Designed. Please hang up and make changes on all your switches. Even though we shouldn't have answered the call and simply ignored it entirely so that another gateway could facilitate your call, we FELT it wise to seriously inconvenience you by answering the call immediately giving no other gateway a chance to place the call. Thanks for using our service and we look forward to abusing you again in the near future.

**UPDATE** \- Problem getting worse, not better **3/30/2009**. I switched DID providers because of problems w/ Voicepulse, such as echo, dropped calls, and consistent registration problems hence calls don't get placed and inbound don't get routed to me. Incidentally, they will not port DIDs, they'll tell you they will, but they don't.

5/23/2009 - They still won't port numbers... Stay away, far away... You have been warned.
