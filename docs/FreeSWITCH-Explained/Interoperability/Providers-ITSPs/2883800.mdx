Nextiva does not use your DID as your username, we generate a unique value that you will need to use. If you don't know it, log into the [Office Manager](https://manage.nextiva.com/) portal and edit your account, you will be able to retrieve your credentials there.

```xml
<include>
  <gateway name="nextiva">
    <!-- Your username, which is not your DID -->
    <param name="username" value="USERNAME"/>
    <param name="password" value="PASSWWORD"/>
    <param name="register" value="true"/>
    <param name="realm" value="sbc.voipdnsservers.com"/>
    <param name="proxy" value="sbc.voipdnsservers.com"/>
    <param name="extension" value="auto_to_user"/>
  </gateway>
</include>
```

## Troubleshooting 

When configuring, you may need to add the following parameter to the gateway setup to get successful registrations and to process calls

```xml
    <param name="from-domain" value="sbc.voipdnsservers.com"/> 
```

If you run into issues with DTMF digits not being processed by IVRs on the remote end, add this to your conf/sip\_profiles/external.xml

```xml
    <param name="dtmf-duration" value="3000"/> 
```

Should the remote end receive double digits from FreeSWITCH, set your phones to send DTMF as SIP INFO and adjust the following in conf/sip\_profiles/internal.xml

```xml
    <param name="liberal-dtmf" value="true"/>
    <param name="dtmf-type" value="info"/> 
```
