## Goal

Some phones like Snom will utilize a multicast paging method, which is actually quite nice if everyone is on the same LAN, or if you're into setting up multicast routing within your VPN. However, this doesn't suit the needs of more distributed environments where the extensions are located on far off networks potentially behind a NAT router, or an environment which one way or another hampers multicast routing.

This "How-To" is an adaptation of the Mad-Boss example given in the Vanilla sample configuration files.

## Cisco-7960 and Linksys SPA-941 Phones

This example below is from an environment where three Cisco 7960 phones are configured with extensions 23X0 - 23X5 and are running the SIP protocol stack.

Line 6 on the phone 23X5 where X is 2,3, or 4 are the only lines configured to auto-answer.

The phones in question, such as a Linksys SPA-941 phone and the Cisco 7960 must have the auto-answer feature enabled on the line used for the intercom.

In the SPA-941 "User" tab you must configure Auto Answer Page = yes.

The SPA-941 will place an individual incoming intercom page on the speaker without intervention if you include the following line in its dialplan extension

\<action application="export" data="sip_auto_answer=true"/>

This will export the setting to the B-leg of the call and send the SIP header to command the SPA-941 into intercom paging mode. When the call terminates the phone returns to an idle state.

As an alternative you can set a custom SIP header that will be recognized by the SPA-941 to do the same thing:

\<action application="set" data="sip_h_Call-info=\<sip:$\{domain}>;answer-after=0"/>

where $\{domain} is simply the domain name or i.p. address of the originating FreeSWITCHâ„¢ server. This inserts the custom header Call-Info into the INVITE.

## Paging Example

This WILL NOT WORK unless you uncomment OPTION 1 or OPTION 2 in the dialplan snippet below! This is done intentionally to make you read the dialplan snippet below. I strongly urge you to read the whole thing as there are comments throughout explaining what it's doing.

PS: many thanks to MikeJ and bkw for their patience and tolerance in fixing the brain damage I sustained writing AEL Dialplans.

## Audio Feedback

Let's say you have a bunch of phones in the same room (a lab for instance), and you get feedback between them when someone talks over the intercom. One thing that I found is that you can alter the conference profile and make a few changes to it that will help mitigate the feedback a small bit. The conference profile below is offered as an example, you may have to tweak it to suit your environment.

No guarantee can be made since the acoustics of your room, the audio characteristics of your speakerphones, among several other variables too numerous to mention will vary and change the dynamics of the situation.

_See notes below about what to change in the Dialplan to use this conference profile._
