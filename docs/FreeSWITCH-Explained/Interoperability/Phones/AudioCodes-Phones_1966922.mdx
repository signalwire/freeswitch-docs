## About

Audiocodes has a few lines of equipment:

* FXS/FXO gateways (MP series).
* PRI gateways (Mediant series).
* IP phones (currently two models: HD310, HD320).

The IP phones product line is in GA phase (general availability), is targeted for various go to markets (hosted environments, contact centers, Asterisk community iPBX, independent 3rd party iPBX vendors). AudioCodes are willing to make changes necessary for Freeswitch support (more details at the phone specific details). 

## IP Phones

The 310HD model is an entry level phone intended for the simple user and is ready for production use. The 320HD is intended for the more sophisticated user (mid range phone), and some needed features are still in development/fixing (like BLF, SLA, soft keys).

The two models are:

### 310HD 

A one line phone (2 concurrent calls per line ) with 10 speed dial keys:

* Registration: Works. Deregister doesn't work cleanly.
* Caller Id: Works. RPID also works.
* Call in/out: Works
* Call waiting: works
* Transfer calls: works
* Park calls: N/A

This is a basic one line phone. It has a large low resolution screen, which has the benefit of large and easily readable fonts. The users quite love the screen. The phone has the basic functionality of in/out calls, hold, transfer and 3-way conference. It has local user's directory.

It has 10 speed dial buttons which can be programmed from the configuration files or the WEB interface. There is no BLF finctionality as the speed dials has no lights.

This is a basic and comfortable phone for the simple user, at a reasonable price (around $80).

#### Management

The phone can be managed either via a configuration file or WEB interface. The configuration file is a simple text file in the format _field=value_. See examples in [Audiocodes\_IP\_phone\_config\_files](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Audiocodes%5FIP%5Fphone%5Fconfig%5Ffiles "Audiocodes IP phone config files")

#### Existing problems

* TLS: See instructions in general configuration files.
* SLA: Not implemented yet. Will be implemented using BroadSoft way toward Q4/2012.
* LDAP: On the way.

### 320HD

A 4 lines phone (2 concurrent calls per line ) with 12 LED speed dial/BLF keys.

* Registration: Works. Deregister doesn't work cleanly.
* Caller Id: Works. RPID also works.
* Call in/out: Works
* Call waiting: works
* Transfer calls: works
* Park calls: N/A

[![Audiocodes 320HD.jpg](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/4/43/Audiocodes_320HD.jpg/600px-Audiocodes_320HD.jpg)](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/File:Audiocodes%5F320HD.jpg)

This is a 4 lines phone with 12 BLF keys (dual color) with a backlitted display. There are 4 soft keys at the screen's bottom which cannot be programmed by the user at present.

The phone has the basic functionality of in/out calls, hold, transfer and 3-way conference. It has local user's directory.

It has 12 speed dial/BLF buttons which can be programmed from the configuration files or the WEB interface. See a note at the BLF section.

It has support for Hebrew fionts (in the CallerID name). Full Hebrew support is on the roadmap.

At present, the phone is suited as a basic phone with a more detailed screen. Once the BLF/SLA is fixed it can be a candidate for a manager/secretary scenario. The phone price is around $100.

#### Soft keys

Soft keys ala Polycom or XML screen ala SNOM are not available. A request has been submitted to Audiocodes to add this functionality.

#### Management

The phone can be managed either via a configuration file or WEB interface. The configuration file is a simple text file in the format _field=value_. See examples in [Audiocodes\_IP\_phone\_config\_files](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Audiocodes%5FIP%5Fphone%5Fconfig%5Ffiles "Audiocodes IP phone config files")

#### BLF

The BLF has been designed toward Asterisk, but it has a "freeswitch" mode. In this mode the key is green while the monitored extension is free, and red when it is ringing or in use. Since it is presence oriented rather than dialog oriented, Freeswitch sends the original phone number at the "ringing" notification, rather than \*\*phone-number as it does with Polycoms/SNOM; Hence, picking the call is impossible.

A request has been made to allow blinking red when ringing, and allow a config parameter to send some prefix before the number at this stage. Audiocodes' already has a test version for it which will be integrated into the next version release.

#### Existing problems

* BLF: See the explanation above.
* TLS: See instructions in general configuration files.
* SLA: Not implemented yet. Will be implemented using BroadSoft way toward Q4/2012.
* LDAP: On the way.

## Configuration Guide

The configuration file is a simple list of lines in the format _key=value_. It is recommened to save the configuration file from a phone and then work on it. It is also suggested to split it into three files: A common one for all phones with the default config, one specific for the site and one specific for each phone.

Upon boot the phone looks for two files: mac-address.cfg (configuration) and [mac-address.sd](http://mac-address.sd) (speed dial/BLF). Each of these can include other files.

A quick note about codecs: if using G722, use G722/8000 (and it will correctly use a 16000 Hz sampling rate). Do not use the option G722/16000 in AudioCodes â€“ it is non-standard and won't work with FreeSWITCH.

In the examples bellow we'll show only the non-standard configuration parameters:

**mac-address**.cfg:

include common_320.cfg
provisioning/speed_dial_uri=**mac-address**.sd   (For speed dials and BLF).
voip/line/0/enabled=1    (one line on 310, 4 lines (0-3) on 320).
voip/line/0/id=8000
voip/line/0/description=Me
voip/line/0/auth_name=8000
voip/line/0/auth_password=PasswordChangeMe
voip/line/0/do_not_disturb/activated=0
voip/line/1/enabled=1
...
personal_settings/language=ENGLISH
personal_settings/lcd_contrast=8

**mac-address**.sd: The format is: index,number,BLF-enabled

1,86800,1  (first key, BLF is on)
2,86800,0  (Second key - only speed dial, no BLF).
12,*55,0   (last key, only speed dial).

**common\_320.cfg** (included from each specific file):

system/type=320HD   (must tell which phone it is)
include common_320_site.cfg  (include the site specific config)
system/watchdog/enabled=1
system/syslog/log_watchdog_events=0
... (the rest is as saved from the phone configuration).

**common\_320\_site.cfg** (included from common\_320.cfg):

## TLS setup

In order to set TLS you have to create two files with extension .**cer** which have the following:

**cafile.cer** - identical to /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/ssl/cafile.pem
**key.cer** - contains conf/ssl/agent.pem with the parts reversed: first the key and then the certificate.

Then, at the config file add the following two lines:

provisioning/certificate/ca_uri=cafile.cer
provisioning/certificate/private_key_uri=key.cer

**Note: TLS is not working well at present. Audiocodes are working on fixing it**
