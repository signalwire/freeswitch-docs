### KX-UT670

The [Panasonic KX-UT670](http://panasonic.net/pcc/products/sipphone/products/kx%5Fut670/index.html) is a top-of-the-line executive desk phone that runs Android 2.2 so it not only is a phone but can become a full-featured terminal much like the one in Captain Picard's ready room. There are no mechanical buttons, only a strip of keys below the 7 inch touch screen. The built-in telephone app puts the necessary numeric digit and function buttons on the screen, but you can write your own app to replace it.

It has 6 "lines" or SIP accounts, 32 soft keys each of which can be programmed as a line key, speed dial, Android application shortcut, web browser bookmark, and other functions. The speakerphone audio on this phone is outstanding and would do justice to the G.722 codec that is included, except that I never had the means to test it properly.

The phone supports Busy Lamp Field buttons, but only after setting **\*\*** as the Directed Call Pickup code in the phone configuration.

* Registration: works
* Caller Id: works
* Call in/out: works
* Call waiting: works, requires multiple line keys to be provisioned
* Call forwarding: works (unconditional, busy, no answer)
* Transfer calls: works, must use Blind Transfer button
* Park calls: works, with feature codes
* MWI: works
* DND: works
* BLF: works, requires Directed Call Pickup code to be configured first
* SRTP: not tested
* TLS: not tested
* Video: N/A
* SIMPLE: not tested

Tested with version 1.072 firmware in the phone. - [Boteman](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/User:Boteman "User:Boteman") 20:50, 24 June 2013 (UTC)

The Globarange phones are made by Panasonic and come (or came) bundled with a Level3 VOIP service called JOIP. They offer dual line capability (PTSN and IP). However they only register to the JOIP service, or so they think.

* Redirect proxy.joip.com to your freeswitch instance. For example on your router add the DNSMaq option:

`address=/proxy.joip.com/<your FS IP Address>`

* Note that the phone needs to get a configuration file at boot time coming from

[http://provisioning.joip.com/joip%5Fconfig/joip0080fXXXXXX.cfg](http://provisioning.joip.com/joip%5Fconfig/joip0080fXXXXXX.cfg)

So do not block it or host locally the file, it is required (0080fXXXXX is the phone mac address).

* The phone wants to do SIP on port 23768\. This cannot be changed, so either use 23768 for SIP in vars.xml or redirect SIP traffic with this on your router:

`iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d proxy.joip.com -p udp -m udp --dport 23768 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5060`

* Usernames and password cannot be changed but can be intercepted with SIP trace. Once done the easiest is to use cidr to avoid authentication issues. It appears that the phones use an authentication challenge with a different user id, and also want to see proxy.joip.com as the domain\_name, but you can ignore this if you use ACL/cidr based registration so:

In your directory/default folder:

```xml
<include>
  <user id="10-digit-id" cidr="phone-ip-address/32">
  ....
```

In your sip\_profiles/internal.xml, enable the following line:

```xml
<param name="apply-register-acl" value="domains"/> 
```

This should enable the registration of the phone at this point. If someone can add how to use number-alias (or something else) in order to simplify internal dialing it would be good. Thx.

### IPBX KX-NCP500

Summary:

* **Registration:** Not tested
* **Caller Id:** Works
* **Call in/out:** Works
* **Call waiting:** Works
* **Transfer calls:** Works
* **Park calls:** Not tested
* **SRTP** Tot tested
* **TLS** Not tested
* **DTMF** Works

SIP Trunking between the NCP500 and FreeSWITCH was established with static IP SIP Trunking (without authentication). The Panasonic can do both, so it's likely authenticated trunks will also work without any issues.

It works perfectly, the SIP in the Panasonic seems clean.
