### ST2030 SIP IP Phone

* **Registration:** works
* **Caller Id:** works
* **Call in/out:** works
* **Call waiting:** works
* **Transfer calls:** works
* **TLS:** not tested yet
* **SRTP:** not tested yet

The features described above do all function as described, so I guess that qualifies the ST2030 as "working" with FreeSWITCH.

However, the call quality is very poor, the phones suffer from noise (hiss) on the line and some "break-up" of speech.

In short, use another phone!

_Note: Using G711A & G711U there is quite a hiss and choppiness, but with mod\_com\_g729 sound problems have been resolved._
