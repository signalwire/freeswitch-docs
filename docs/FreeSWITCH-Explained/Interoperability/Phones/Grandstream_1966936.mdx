### Grandstream HandyTone 488

FXS side of things appears to work well. I haven't tested caller ID, nor the FXO side of the device.

Caller ID works on FXS port (FreeSWITCH 1.0) from SIP originated calls. Also, had issues with upgraded firmware -- reset configuration (\*\*\*99) and all was well again. I also have not tested FXO port. Jpeterson275 23:19, 2 December 2008 (PST)

Surprisingly good ULaw sound over wan (cable modem).

Also, surprisingly effective NAT support.

DTMF tones seem to be failing when connected to the IVR module (but working when forwarded through to the free 800 # service).

### Grandstream HandyTone 502

July 2009: Firmware: 1.0.1.35

According to homepage "SIP over TCP/TLS". But it doesn´t work.

Summary:

* **Registration:** works with SIP over UDP and TCP.
* **Caller Id:** not tested
* **Call in/out:** Works
* **Call waiting:** not tested
* **Transfer calls:** not tested
* **Park calls:** not tested
* **SRTP** not tested
* **TLS** doesn´t register, see below
* **DTMF** not tested
* **FAX over G.711** Works
* **FAX over T.38** Works

Talking about TLS:

In fact there are fields where you can enter your certificate, the private key and the password for the private key. It doesn't register with TLS, but only UDP and TCP. I tried with Pangolin, where TLS works without any problem (importing the CA certifacte of FS). FreeSWITCH tells me:

### Grandstream HandyTone 503

June 2009: This device is supposed to support TLS + SRTP - only ATA that is known to have it (?)

Summary:

* **Registration:** FXS works with SIP over UDP, TCP. Works 2% of time with TLS.
* **Caller Id:** FXS works with SIP over UDP
* **Call in/out:** FXS works with SIP over UDP (call drops sometimes - see below). Does NOT work with TCP or TLS
* **Call waiting:** not tested
* **Transfer calls:** not tested
* **Park calls:** not tested
* **SRTP** FXS works
* **TLS** FXS registration did not work 98% of time (without setup change), but can never make/receive calls
* **DTMF** FXS works with FS IVR module

Details:

What works:

FXS SIP over UDP, RTP & SRTP, DTMF with IVR also found to work fine (with DTMF order set in devices as: RFC, INFO, in audio). Caller id also worked fine. Audio was quite clear with default codec order.

STUN, device behind NAT can make/receive calls and audio fine with FS (that also happened to be behind its own NAT (with UPnP support and using FS autonat feature))

What doesn't work:

FXS with SIP over TCP or TLS - registration works. However nothing else works - no calls can be made or received with SIP over TCP or TLS. Exact same setup eyebeam and snom work, so problem is not with FS.

Calls get dropped sometimes in between due to problem with HT 503 (not FS) sometimes. For a valid call and call id, HT 503 returns "SIP/2.0 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist"

Please update wiki with any known results/fix for TCP/TLS and call drops. Also results with FXO.

January 2011 - Requires the latest HT503 firmware update to work properly. FXS works properly and FXO functions properly but registers by default as an extension not as a gateway. HT503 FXO default setting need the "Preferred DTMF method" setting set to "RFC2833" to connect. Also there are two ways to get the FXO to send calls: the first (not recommended) requires a dialplan that calls the fxo extension to get the dial tone and then the dialplan needs to dial the number. Able to make it work by using the following lines in the dial plan.

```xml
      <action application="queue_dtmf" data="W$1@100"/>
      <action application="bridge" data="user/1003"/>
      <action application="answer"/>
```

A better way to make the FXO connection is to create a gateway for the FXO but do not request registration (never was able to get it to register) using the 5062 port- example -

```xml
   <gateway name="ht503-1">
     <param name="realm" value="192.168.0.82:5062"/>
     <param name="proxy" value="192.168.0.82:5062"/>
     <param name="expire-seconds" value="800"/>
     <param name="register" value="false"/>
     <param name="retry-seconds" value="60"/>
     <param name="context" value="public"/>
   </gateway>

```

Then when you make a call you can create a dialplan like the one below, it sends local calls to the first HT503 that answers.

```xml
  <extension name="Local 7 digit calls" >
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d{7})$">
      <action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_name=${outbound_caller_id_name}"/>
      <action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=${outbound_caller_id_number}"/>
      <action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
      <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/ht503-2/$1@192.168.0.85:5062"/>
      <action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/ht503-1/$1@192.168.0.82:5062"/>
  </condition>
  </extension>
```

**Using for Loudspeaker Paging/Overhead Paging** The HT503 can be used as a gateway to a traditional PBX amplifier if the amplifier can connect to a CO or FX0 port (one that can provide line or battery power to the tip and ring) such as a Valcom V-200A.

1. Configure a user for the HT503 to register to
2. Configure the HT503  
   1. SIP Server and login information  
   2. Wait for Dial Tone (P3303) = No  
   3. Stage Method (P3304) = 1  
   4. Unconditional Call forward to PSTN (P796) = #
3. If your amplifier has an RJ-11 port, connect a cable from the "Line" port on the HT503 to the RJ-11 port on the amplifier. If not, cut the end off an RJ-11 cable and expose enough of the red (tip) and green (ring) wires to connect to the tip and ring inputs on the amplifier.
4. Make sure that line or battery power on the amplifier is "turned on"
5. Attach the speaker
6. Power all devices
7. Create a dialplan, conference, etc. entry that connects a call to the device you defined
8. Your voice should be heard over the speaker
