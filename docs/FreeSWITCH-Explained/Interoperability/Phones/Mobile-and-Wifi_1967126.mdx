All newer Nokia phones support STUN. This is configurable through XML provisioning files or the [SIP VoIP Settings tool](http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118118) which can be downloaded [here](http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/d476061e-90ca-42e9-b3ea-1a852f3808ec/SIP%5FVoIP%5FSettings.html). This tool can also be used to modify the codec list and tweak codec specific parameters.

#### Nokia TLS Setup / Symbian S60 TLS Setup

* First import a root certificate (in DER format!) into the device. You can use the following command to convert a certificate that has been created using gentls\_cert script:

```xml
openssl x509 -in /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/ssl/CA/cacert.pem -out /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/ssl/CA/cacert.cer -outform DER
```

* Copy the new cacert.cer to the device, and open it (e.g. in file manager). This will prompt you the save it as a trusted certificate. Do this and select all trust levels during installation.
* Setup your SIP Profile using "sips:" instead of "sip:" in Public Username, Proxy Server Address and Register Server Address, and set the appropriate port for your FreeSWITCH installation.

**ATTENTION:** Set the "Transport type" to "AUTO" or it will not work!

This configuration is only for SIP TLS. SRTP has not yet been tested.

SIP/TLS has been tested on:

* Nokia N95 (RM-159) with firmware v30.0.015 from 15-Jul-2008 (Nokia N95 01.01)
* Nokia N95 8GB (RM-320) with firmware v31.0.0.15 from 07-Nov-2008 (Nokia N95 01.01)
* Nokia E52 (RM-469) with firmware v52.003.C00.01 from 29-Oct-2010 (Nokia E52-1)

##### Nokia Issues

* sip works only if your sip server has port 5060, no other ports

### Wi-Fi Only Phones

These are wifi only phones, as opposed to locked cell phones that can use wifi also.

#### Loctec WP04

This phone has a limited number of codecs and no extra buttons for hold, park, etc. It does, however, have a good battery life and is a good fit where you need a cordless station with minimal features.

The phone does not negotiate codecs well, so you will want to limit the codec in the global\_codec\_prefs in vars.xml to be as follows:

```xml
global_codec_prefs=G722,PCMU,PCMA,GSM
```
