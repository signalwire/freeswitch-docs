Conference rooms do not work because the phone is obviously using 30ms RTP packets but it is not advertising it. This results in some very weird sound-effects for the other people in the room. We will file a bug at AVM for that. As a workaround you can set the 20ms manually in the config file, see [this article](http://wiki.snom.com/FAQ/How%5Fto%5Ffix%5Fmy%5FSnom%5Fphone%27s%5Faudio%5Fproblems%5Fwith%5FFritzbox%3F) at SNOM for hints.
