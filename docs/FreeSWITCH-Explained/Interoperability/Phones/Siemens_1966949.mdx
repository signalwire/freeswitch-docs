### Gigaset S675 / S685 IP

Latest Tested Release: 047.00   
  
The Gigaset S675 and S685 SIP DECT phones work well and supports wideband G.722 codec out of the box. To ensure correct DTMF support with G.722 wideband enabled, make sure [RFC 2833](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2833) is selected in Telephony->Advanced Settings on your base station.   
To configure correct message waiting indicator support from the network, you have to disable the built-in answering machine. You will know if this is configured correctly as the tape icon on top of the screen will change to a network icon. Voicemail message waiting indications will show the number of FreeSWITCH voicemails on the left side of the screen and update very quickly.   
ECO DECT can be configured from the phone in Settings->Base->Add. Features->Eco Mode for significant phone power conservation. The only caveat is you will need to use the same family of DECT phones on the base station - you cannot mix model numbers of Gigaset phones.
