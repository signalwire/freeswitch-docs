## About

FSClient is a full Windows sip client that uses [Embedded FreeSWITCH](../../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Embedding-FreeSWITCH/index.mdx#php) and is written in WPF/.NET 4.0\. It supports external and internal contact books and full headset features through a plugin system. FSClient is meant to be a full featured SIP client including standard enterprise class client functionality. It can run installed or run standalone, with the only requirement being .NET 4.0 support. As it is open source it can also serve as an example towards using embedded FreeSWITCH. For further information please see its github page at: <https://github.com/mitchcapper/FSClient>
