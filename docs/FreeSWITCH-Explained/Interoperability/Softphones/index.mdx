## CounterPath products

### [X-Lite](https://www.counterpath.com/x-lite.html)

* **Registration:** works
* **Caller Id:** works
* **Call in/out:** works
* **Call waiting:** works
* **Transfer calls:** not tested

X-Lite release 1105d build stamp 99999 Registrations, Calling in and out works

X-Lite Version 3.0 build 47546: Registrations, Calling in and out works

### [Eyebeam](https://www.counterpath.com/eyebeam.html)

* **Registration:** works
* **Caller Id:** works
* **Call in/out:** work
* **Call waiting:** works
* **Transfer calls:** works
* **TLS/SRTP:** works

Please note eyebeam cannot \*receive\* an SRTP call (although can \*make\* a call), unless TLS is also turned on. This issue was posted in their forum, but not resolved, looks like their support itself doesn't know that they accept SRTP calls only if TLS is enabled. (It responds with SIP/2.0 415 No secure channel available for encrypted call)

#### EyeBeam TLS Setup

(Tested on Windows with EyeBeam 1.5.19 build 47739)

* On the account properties go to the _Security_ tab. Choose _TLS_ as signaling transport.
* Get a copy of the cafile.pem file and rename it to cafile.crt. Install the certificate in the _trusted root certificate_ store (double click in the file explorer).

If you see an error like "Certificate Validation Failure", you didn't do this right.

If you get the error, "Certificate Name Mismatch", then the server's certificate name and the name of the domain you put in eyebeam don't match. Yes, eyebeam checks for that too. Phonerlite can be made not to and its a nice neat portable software (but has some issues of its own - see above. Hopefully these will be fixed soon).

  
Note if FS is down or for other reasons if eyebeam can't register, it says certificate problem instead of saying registration failed sometimes.

### [Bria](https://www.counterpath.com/bria.html)

## [PortGo Softphone](http://www.portsip.com/portgo-softphone)

Formerly known as Pangolin. This is a free softphone that is capable of SIP-TLS + SRTP calls! It is available for Android, iOS, and Windows, but might require payment for some versions.

## [PhonerLite](http://www.phonerlite.de/)

* **Registration:** works
* **Caller Id:** works
* **Call in/out:** work
* **Call waiting:** works
* **Transfer calls:** unknown
* **Park calls:** unknown
* **TLS/SRTP:** works (?)

To enable TLS, have the certificate loaded into the windows certificate store and check boxes 'check certificate from remote side' and 'Load Windows CA' under tab Certificate. Select TLS for 'Preferred Connection Type' under tab Network. (cafile.pem rename to cafile.crt, double click in explorer and install into root certificate store, trust publishers won't work - it simply does TCP even if you select TLS unless you put in root certificate store) (I could not get TLS to work ever with PhonerLite, handshake starts but does not finish registration. Among 20 trials it did work once ! But without any change in anything did not work a moment later. Please post any details to get it to work here. Thanks.)

To enable RTP, select SRTP and SAVP under tab Codecs

This is a free softphone that is capable of SIP-TLS + SRTP calls!

Software is completely portable, you can carry on a USB stick too. You can change the port number in the settings, if not if phonerlite is open, FreeSWITCH (Windows) on the same machine can't use port 5060, unless it is started first.

Please note : if TLS doesn't work or not supported by the server, it automatically does TCP which is BAD!! Please suggest in their forum to fix this. The more people suggest more likely they will add a force TLS option.

Also I found some strange issues with "not using check certificate from remote side" which I understood to be not checking validity of the certificate (if its signed by one of the roots in the windows certificate store) but would still do TLS. It did do TLS, but I could not get the handshake to complete. Appears to be some issue with the ports. (And in this case did not fallback to TCP) If anyone knows how to fix this, or has seen otherwise, please post here ! When check remote certificate is selected, with or without load windows CA being selected, it falls back to TCP

As a workaround (per support \[Thanks Joachim!\]) you can disable message waiting indication. This issue has been resolved in version 3 of Zoiper Communicator (aka Zoiper 3). (2013.09.04)
