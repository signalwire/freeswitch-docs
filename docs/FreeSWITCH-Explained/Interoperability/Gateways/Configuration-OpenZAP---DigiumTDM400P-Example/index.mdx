# Configuration OpenZAP - DigiumTDM400P Example 

 

## About

Instructions on using the [Digium TDM400P](http://www.digium.com/en/products/telephony-cards/analog/4-port) 4-port analog card in FreeSWITCH™.

OpenZAP has been superseded by FreeTDM. OpenZAP development is stalled and no new features will be developed. Use [FreeTDM archived](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=7766119) instead.

## Hardware Configuration

Affix the 2 FXS cards (green) on channels 1 and 3, and the 2 FXO cards (red) on channels 2 and 4, respectively, on the Digium TDM400P card.

In this example channel 1 is the port at the top of the card, with channel 4 being next to the PCI connector at the bottom. The card for channel 1 is next to the telephone connectors, and the card for channel 4 is on the other side.

That is:

| channels | usage               | type / zaptel.cfg | signalling / openzap.cfg |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2 and 4  | telephone line      | FXO               | FXS                      |
| 1 and 3  | telephone extension | FXS               | FXO                      |

Turn off your machine and insert the Digium TDM400P card with 2 FXS / 2 FXO into your machine.

Ensure a hard-drive power cable is properly inserted into the end of the card.

## Zaptel Driver Installation

The FXO/FXS card should be installed first to verify the Zaptel installation. Verify Internet connectivity.

Download the latest zaptel-1.4.x.tar.gz from reliable sources. Untar the source tarball, compile, and install.

**Build Zaptel driver**

```bash
tar -zxvf zaptel-1.4.x.tar.gz
cd zaptel-1.4.x
./configure
make
make install
make config
```

Ensure the proper zaptel.conf is in the /etc directory. Correctly configure the country zone in zaptel.conf. FXO and FXS are reversed in /etc/zaptel.conf but are normal everywhere else.

**/etc/zaptel.conf**

```xml
loadzone=in
defaultzone=in
fxsks=4
fxoks=1
fxsks=2
fxoks=3 
```

Add the wctdm and zaptel modules now.

```xml
modprobe wctdm
modprobe zaptel
```

Now verify the installation with the ztcfg command

```xml
ztcfg -vv

Zaptel Version: 1.4.2
Echo Canceller: MG2
Configuration

2 channels configured.

```

## Setup

1\. Once you are done with installing zaptel drivers and fixed the FXS/FXO card in your machine, the green LEDs (Digium TDM400P card in this case) on your card will start glowing. (Good omen for you)

2\. When you compile the Freeswitch code, make sure you have included the openzap module by uncommenting the following line in ${Freeswitch\_src)/modules.conf

../../libs/openzap/mod\_openzap

3\. After successful compilation, you manually have to copy the openzap.conf.xml file into /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/ as it will not be copied there automatically. For example, you can use the sample openzap.conf.xml for Digium TDM400P at [Openzap.conf.xml Examples](./Openzap-Configuration-Examples_7766117.mdx#about)

4\. At the time of running FreeSWITCH from /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/, make sure again that &lt;load module ="mod\_openzap"/> is included in /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml

5.Make sure you see the Openzap FXS and FXO configuration messages on your console when you run Freeswitch. For example,

2008-05-01 18:10:32 [INFO] zap_zt.c:170 zt_open_range() configuring device /dev/zap/channel channel 1 as OpenZAP  device 1:1 fd:33

6\. Now you can take a ride on your Ozzzzzzz... zip zap zoom ;)

### Dialplan Configuration

1\. To bridge an inbound call to your FXS that is configured on channel 1, for an UA registered as 507@proxy.com configure as below

&lt;extension name="incoming-fxs-channel-1">
  &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^(507)$">
    &lt;action application="bridge" data="openzap/1/1"/>
  &lt;/condition>
&lt;/extension>

2\. To bridge an outbound call onto your FXO card that is configured on channel 4, for any 10-digit destination configure as below

```xml
<extension name="outgoing-fxo-channel-4">
 <condition field="destination_number" expression="^([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])$"> 
  <action application="set" data="dialed_ext=$1"/> 
  <action application="bridge" data="openzap/2/2/${dialed_ext}"/> 
 </condition> 
</extension>
```
