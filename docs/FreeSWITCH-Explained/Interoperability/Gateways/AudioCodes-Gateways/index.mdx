## About

AudioCodes gateways information.

### AudioCodes

Audiocodes has a few lines of equipment:

* FXS/FXO gateways (MP series).
* PRI gateways (Mediant series).
* IP phones (currently two models: HD310, HD320).

#### FXS/FXO gateways

* **AudioCodes MediaPack MP114 FXS SIP**
* **AudioCodes MediaPack MP118 FXS SIP**
* **AudioCodes MediaPack MP118 8-FXO SIP**

We had to add the IP of the FreeSWITCH sip server as the "Gateway Registration Name" and "Gateway Name" inside of the MediaPack. Default internal SIP profile without "suppress-cng" ="true", will cause terrible background noise heard on the internal SIP phones, when working with MP118 FXO

* **AudioCodes MediaPack MP118 4-FXS/4-FXO SIP Mixed Configuration. Inbound routing with CallerID, outbound routing and internal extensions work. with:**_sip\_profiles/internal.xml: \<param name="suppress-cng" value="false"/>_

#### PRI gateways

The Mediant series is intended for PRI to SIP/H.323 gateways. It has a few modular and non-modular configurations, ranging from 1 E1/T1 to 16xE1/T1.

I had it for loan for a week - it looks OK, but I didn't have the chance to fully evaluate it in production.
