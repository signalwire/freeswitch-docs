## Channel state

Reflect the state of the channel on the board. In the case of E1 links, the state may have one or more of the following:

* **Free**: the channel is free;
* **Busy**: the channel is not free (or occupied, or failure);
* **Outgoing**: the channel has an output connection;
* **Incoming**: the channel has an input connection;
* **Locked**: the channel is blocked;
* **Outgoing Lock**: The channel is blocked for outgoing calls;
* **Local Fail**: The channel has a fault (at this point);
* **Incoming Lock**: the channel is blocked for incoming calls;
* **Remote Lock**: there is a remote lock (at the other end) in this channel.

In the case of a FXS channel, the state is defined by one of these values:

* **On Hook**: the phone connected to this channel is on-hook or disconnected;
* **Off Hook**: the phone connected to this channel is off the hook;
* **Ringing**: the channel is being called;
* **Failure**: the channel is in failure due to communication problems between the central and the plate.

In the case of a GSM channel, the state is defined by one of the following values:

* **Idle**: the channel is free and available for calls;
* **Call In Progress**: the channel is busy on a call;
* **SMS In Progress**: the channel is busy sending / receiving SMS messages;
* **Modem Error**: an error occurred communicating with the modem channel;
* **SIM Card Error**: The SIM card is not present or is not inserted / detected correctly;
* **Network Error**: an error occurred while communicating with the network;
* **Not Ready**: The modem is initializing the channel.

And in the case of an FXO channel, the states are as follows:

* **Disabled**: the channel is disabled;
* **Enabled**: the channel is enabled.

## Call state

Defines the logical state for each channel, which can be:

* **Free**: the channel is free;
* **Incoming**: the channel is receiving a call;
* **Outgoing**: the channel is making a call;
* **Failure**: the channel is in fault.

## FreeSWITCH call states

Directly reflects the call state controlled by FreeSWITCH, which can be:

* **new**: Channel is newly created;
* **init**: Channel has been initialized;
* **routing**: Channel is looking for an extension to execute;
* **execute**: Channel is executing its dialplan;
* **ex\_media**: Channel is exchanging media with another channel;
* **cs\_media**: Channel is consuming all media;
* **hangup**: Channel is flagged for hangup and ready to end.
