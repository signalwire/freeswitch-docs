## Contexts for E1 channels

For E1 boards, inbound contexts are predefined as option **context-digital** with default value as following:

```xml
<param name="context-digital" value="khomp-DD-LL"/>
```

This standard defines the context that links will be redirected in accordance with the number of the board and number of the link: **DD** is the device number (two digits), and **LL** is the number of the link (also with two digits).

However, it is possible to configure other inbound contexts, with different formats. There is format **CCC**, which means the channel number on the card (three digits), and **SSSS**, which represents the serial board number (with four digits).

Examples for configuration entries (**khomp.conf.xml**):

```xml
<!-- Serial board number and sequential link (ex: khomp-01-00) -->
<param name="context-digital" value="khomp-DD-LL"/>

<!-- Serial board number and sequential link (ex: khomp-3049-00) -->
<param name="context-digital" value="khomp-SSSS-LL"/>

<!-- Sequential board number and the channel (ex: khomp-00-001) -->
<param name="context-digital" value="khomp-DD-CCC"/>

<!-- Receive all calls in one context (khomp-digital) -->
<param name="context-digital" value="khomp-digital"/>
```

Follows an example the context usage inside the dialplan:

```xml
<!--
The present context in 'extensions.conf' will handle calls
that come from the link 0 (first link) of the board 0.
-->
<context name="khomp-00-00">
             .
             .
             .
</context>
```

Another example, using the same format:

```xml
<!-- 
The present context in 'extensions.conf' will handle calls
that come from the link 1 (second link) of the board 0.
-->
<context name="khomp-00-01>
             .
             .
             .
</context>
```

A complete example, with a few simple actions:

```xml
<context name="khomp-00-00">
    <extension name="exemplo_1">
        <condition field="destination_number" expression="^1234$">
            <action application="bridge" data="Khomp/b0L1/2345"/>
        </condition>
    </extension>
    <extension name="exemplo_2">
        <condition field="destination_number" expression="^23(\d{2})$">
            <action application="bridge" data="sofia/${use_profile}/11$1@${sip_from_host}"/>
        </condition>
    </extension>
</context>

<context name="khomp-00-01">
    <extension name="exemplo_3">
        <condition field="destination_number" expression="^1111$">
            <action application="bridge" data="Khomp/b0L0/2345"/>
        </condition>
    </extension>
</context>
```

This dialplan defines that:

1. The incoming calls on the link **0** of the board **0** will have the following handling:  
   * Calls to the extension 1234 for will be redirected to the second link on the first board (b0L1), calling number **2345**;  
   * Calls to any four digit number starting with**23** will be redirected to SIP phones numbered **11** plus the last two digits of the number dialed.
2. The incoming calls on the link **1** of the board **0** for the number **1111** will be redirected to the first link of the first board (b0L0) calling number **2345**.

## Contexts of FXS/FXO/GSM channels

Just as in the context of E1 cards, inbound links are forwarded to the Endpoint FreeSwitch.

The context is pre-defined as follows, according to the file **khomp.conf.xml**:

```xml
<param name="context-gsm" value="khomp-DD-CC"/> ;placas GSM

<param name="context-fxs" value="khomp-DD-CC"/> ; placas FXS

<param name="context-fxo" value="khomp-DD-CC"/> ; placas FXO
```

For these options, **DD** is the device number (two digits), and **CC** is the channel number (also two digits). There is also the **SSSS** format, which represents the serial number board.

In the **KGSM** board, incoming calls are **always** redirected to the **"s"** extension, since the GSM protocol does not identify the target number, only the originator - if not omitted.

## Priority settings on the FXS branches

On calls originated from an FXS branch, the Endpoint searches for a valid extension (digits sent) after the DTMF **#** or after the _timeout_ (option **fxs-digit-timeout**). That search is done in the context defined in section **\<fxs-options>**, or if no context configured, the search is done in context defined in **context-fxs**. 

## Contexts for SMS messages (GSM only)

SMS messages are received by the Khomp _Endpoint_ and forwarded to FreeSWITCH as a normal connection but no audio, which has some variables set with information received in the message - for more information on these variables, see the documentation of the variables of the _Endpoint_. This context can also be modified in the same way as the above contexts.

The default value for this option follows (**khomp.conf.xml**):

```xml
<param name="context-gsm-sms" value="khomp-sms-DD-CC"/> 
```

Where **DD** is the device number (two digits), and **CC** is the channel number (also with two digits). For example:

```xml
<context name="khomp-sms-00-01">
    <extension name="sms">
        <condition field="destination_number" expression="^s$">
            <action application="log" data="DEBUG KSmsType=${KSmsType}"/>
            <action application="log" data="DEBUG KSmsBody=${KSmsBody}"/>
        </condition>
    </extension>
</context>
```

## Contexts for Khomp_PR channels (KPR)

For these cards, inbound links have a pre-defined context, as shown below:

```xml
<param name="context-pr" value="khomp-DD-CC"/> 
```

In this case, **DD** is the device number (two digits), and**CC** is the channel number (also two digits). The name and format of this context can also be changed through the "context-pr" in the configuration file. 

## Groups contexts

The section **groups**, in the configuration file **khomp.conf.xml**, can be used to define specific settings for certain groups of channels.

This section is detailed in the section **Endpoint Configuration**.
