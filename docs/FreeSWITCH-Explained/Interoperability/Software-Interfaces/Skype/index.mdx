FreeSWITCH can use Skype!

## Skype Interconnect Options

* [Skype Connect](./Skype-Connect_13173678.mdx#about): Skype now offers Skype for SIP through Skype Connect. This offers the best integration with FreeSWITCH, but there are some limitations: Skype Connect is for businesses only; reselling is not allowed; Skype Connect handles incoming calls from Skype users, but outgoing calls only to landlines.
* [mod\_skypopen](../../../Modules/mod_skypopen_3966336.mdx): Skypopen (former skypiax) is an endpoint (channel driver) that uses Skype client(s) as interface(s) to the Skype network, and allows incoming and outgoing Skype calls to/from FreeSWITCH (that can be bridged, originated, answered, etc. as in all other endpoints, e.g. sofia/SIP). Features multiple lines, multiple concurrent incoming and outbound calls, works on Windows and Linux.
* [SipTheeSkype](./SipTheeSkype-Skype-Adapter_1967135.mdx#usage): SipToSIS interconnects with FreeSWITCH as an add-on adapter to a Skype client running on the same machine. The adapter acts as a single-line client user-agent to FreeSWITCH that can send and receive calls just like any other UA. SipTheeSkype also allows for some basic switching capabilities in both directions.
