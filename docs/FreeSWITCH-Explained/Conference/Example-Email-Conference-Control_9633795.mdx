# Example Email Conference Control 

 

## About

by excelsio 2010.04.20 (ancient)

Currently we have a nice script [Examples\_JavaScript\_Conference\_IVR](JavaScript-Conference-IVR_7144056.mdx#about) for setting up a publicly available conferencing system.

Unfortunatelay I haven´t seen any possibility for my users to create their own conferences. In the following I´ll show some hints for setting up a kind of basic email based remote control for the IVR based conference mentioned above. Users from your given domain will write an email with subject ADD and a body consisting of the triplet: conf\_room mod\_password conf\_name This will finally add an entry to your MySQL database.

## Features

ADDing a conference room entry

## Issues

* no checking whether there´s already a conference room with the given number. So the entries in you database will be overwritten by the next email with the same conf\_room name
* no EDIT of conference rooms
* no DELETE of conference rooms

## Email Example

If you want to set up a conference room with number 10000, moderator password of 123456 and name Conference, your users will have to write an email with:

```text
Subject: ADD
Body: 10000 123456 Conference
```

### Procmail Configuration

Everything that comes from my mail server, having an email address ending within [mydomain.com](http://mydomain.com) and subject ADD will be parsed to the insert script which will itself make some modifications on the database called freeswitch. Look at the "b" of :0b\*. This will forward only the body of the email. The rest, i.e. :0: will be thrown away. This will be your .procmail.rc

```text
PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:.
MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir/
DEFAULT=$HOME/Maildir/
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/procmail.log

:0b*
* ^Received:.*mydomain.com
* ^From:.*mydomain.com
* ^To: conferencecontrol@mydomain.com
* ^Subject: ADD
|/usr/src/insert | mysql -uYOUR_DB_USER -pYOURPASSWORD freeswitch

:0:
/dev/null
```

### Insert script

This is written with the help of awk.

```cpp
#!/bin/awk -f

BEGIN {
FS=" "
}
{
        if (length($0) == 0) next

        if (NF != 3) {
                print "error line: "NR
                exit
        }

        do {
                printf ("insert into freeswitch.conferences (conf_room, mod_password, conf_name) VALUES (" $1 ", " $2 ", " $3 ")\n");
        } while (true)
}
```

### Fetchmail configuration

This will download the emails with POP3 protocol from your provider. So this will be your .fetchmail.rc Change owner from .fetchmailrc with chown fetchmail ./fetchmailrc

```xml
poll pop.mydomain.com with proto POP3
 user "conferencecontrol@mydomain.com" there with password "YOURPASSWORD is "YOURLOCALUSERWITHTHE.configFILES" here
mda "/usr/bin/procmail -d %s"
```

  
### Crontab

Finally crontab will automatically run fetchmail every minute:

```xml
0-59/1 * * * * /usr/bin/fetchmail -av
```
