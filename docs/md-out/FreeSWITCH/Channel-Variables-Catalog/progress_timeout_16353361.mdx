## progress_timeout

integer This is the maximum time we will wait before we get media (whether it's early media, ringing or answer) e.g. maximum PDD before abandoning the route -- the time from Sending the INVITE to receiving the first ringing response for example: a SIP/2.0 180 Ringing or 183\. Typical fixed lines have a PDD of under 3 seconds, and mobiles of under 8 seconds.

> I set my progress\_timeout to 13 seconds to accommodate for slow-setup mobile connections, however, it can probably be shorter. -- [Avi Marcus](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/~avimarcus)

Two scenarios:

1. If a carrier is having issues with their platform, _all_ calls might timeout.
2. If it's not a carrier issue -- if a single carrier timed out at 13 seconds and the user actually waited, the call rarely connected via any other carrier (although they all expired at 13 seconds).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="progress_timeout=20"/>
```
