## drop_dtmf_masking_file

string If `drop_dtmf` is `true`, play specified file for every tone received.

**Usage**

Each DTMF tone that is entered into the a-leg will be dropped and the file `dtmf_masking_tone` played to the b-leg.

```xml
<action application="export" data="drop_dtmf=true"/>
<action application="export" data="drop_dtmf_masking_file=/etc/freeswitch/Sounds/dtmf_masking_tone"/>
```

To drop and replace DTMF on the b-leg use

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:drop_dtmf=true"/>
<action application="export" data="nolocal:drop_dtmf_masking_file=/etc/freeswitch/Sounds/dtmf_masking_tone" />
```
