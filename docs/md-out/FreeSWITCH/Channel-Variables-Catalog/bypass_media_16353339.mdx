## bypass_media

boolean When set, the media (RTP) from the originating endpoint is sent directly to the destination endpoint and vice versa. The signaling (SIP) for both endpoints still goes through FreeSWITCH, but the media is point-to-point. See also: [Bypass Media Overview](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Codecs-and-Media/Bypass-Media-Overview/index.mdx#faq)

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="bypass_media=true"/>
```
