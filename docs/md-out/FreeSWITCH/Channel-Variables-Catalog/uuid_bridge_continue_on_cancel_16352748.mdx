## uuid_bridge_continue_on_cancel

boolean When set to `true` causes the system to move on in the dialplan if it hits a bad b-leg. Default is `false` because this behavior is probably not recommended. You may find this variable useful when implementing [Dialplan FollowMe](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Dialplan-FollowMe_9634428.mdx#about).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="uuid_bridge_continue_on_cancel=true"/>
```
