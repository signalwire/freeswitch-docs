## conference_controls

string Set this variable to specify which conference control set to use when transferring a caller into a conference. This allows you, for example, to have a control set for the conference moderator and another control set for regular conference members. The control set for the moderator could include the ability to mute or kick people, for example.

![(informazioni)](/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) You must create the desired conference control set. Also, if this is not set then the default conference control set is used for the conference member.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="conference_controls=moderator"/>
```
