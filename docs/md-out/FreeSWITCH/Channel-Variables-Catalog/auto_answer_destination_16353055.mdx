## auto_answer_destination

string In an inbound call, the remote side may send a `SIP NOTIFY` message with the event type `talk`, telling Sofia endpoint to answer the call. In this case, the variable `auto_answer_destination` is set to the channel's [destination\_number](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#destination_number), and the call is transferred to the extension `auto_answer` within current dialplan and context.
