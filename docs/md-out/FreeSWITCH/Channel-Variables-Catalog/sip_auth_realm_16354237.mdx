## sip_auth_realm

string This should contain the domain/realm of the authenticated user that has triggered the event, if applicable.

**Usage**

```xml
originate {sip_auth_username=<your_user_name>,sip_auth_password=<your_password>}sofia/external/1xxxxxxx@12.34.56.78 &echo
```

Depending on how your FreeSWITCH instance is configured, you may experience problems with this variable being incorrect or blank after calling the 'bridge' application. If this happens, you may want to force the channel variable:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{sip_auth_realm=${sip_auth_realm}}sofia/gateway/external/2000"/>
```
