## sip_hangup_disposition

string This variable contains the value of who sent the SIP BYE message. Some examples from XML CDRs:

```xml
<sip_hangup_disposition>send_bye</sip_hangup_disposition>
<sip_hangup_disposition>recv_bye</sip_hangup_disposition>
<sip_hangup_disposition>send_refuse</sip_hangup_disposition>
<sip_hangup_disposition>send_cancel</sip_hangup_disposition>
```

Interpretation of these values differs on incoming and outgoing calls since FreeSWITCH is at different ends of the session:

| Value        | Incoming                                       | Outgoing                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| send\_bye    | FS sent BYE to the caller (we hung up)         | FS sent BYE to the endpoint (we hung up)         |
| recv\_bye    | FS received BYE from the caller (they hung up) | FS received BYE from the endpoint (they hung up) |
| send\_refuse | FS rejected the call (e.g. 4xx or 5xx)         | Endpoint rejected the call (e.g. 4xx or 5xx)     |
| send\_cancel | _n/a_                                          | FS aborted the call (we sent CANCEL)             |
