## sip_execute_on_image

string Execute an application as soon as you get a T.38 invite. This variable is similar to [execute\_on\_answer](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#execute_on_answer). You can run t38\_gateway or rxfax etc when you get a T.38 re-invite but no CNG tone, or you want to ignore the tone and only react when getting a T.38 re-invite.
