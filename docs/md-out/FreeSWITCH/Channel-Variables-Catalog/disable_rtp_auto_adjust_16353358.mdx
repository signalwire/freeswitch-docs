## disable_rtp_auto_adjust

string Disable rtp auto adjust if it is not behaving as you expected. It stops the switch from rewriting the RTP destination based on the source. When RTP Auto-Adjust is ON FreeSWITCH will change the destination RTP address to match the source of the incoming packets, this doesn't work if the other end is really wanting to send and receive on a different addr.

**Usage**

```xml
Add {disable_rtp_auto_adjust=true} in your dial string.
```
