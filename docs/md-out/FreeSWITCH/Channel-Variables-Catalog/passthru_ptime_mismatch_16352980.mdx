## passthru_ptime_mismatch

boolean If `ptime` from leg A and leg B don't match and if [mod\_com\_g729](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_com_g729_1049284.mdx#about) is used, the call would normally use the codec to re-packetize the RTP stream.

With this parameter, [mod\_com\_g729](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_com_g729_1049284.mdx#about) will re-packetize without decoding/encoding, as [mod\_g729](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_g729_3375549.mdx#about) would do.

**Usage**

This has to be set in `{}` before bridging. That will probably not work if set using `export` before bridging.

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{passthru_ptime_mismatch=true}sofia/gateway/trunk/$1"/>
```

Globally in `vars.xml`

```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="passthru_ptime_mismatch=true"/>
```
