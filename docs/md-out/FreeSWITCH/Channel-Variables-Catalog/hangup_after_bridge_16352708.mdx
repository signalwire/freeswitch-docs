# hangup_after_bridge 

 Created by  Ryan Harris, last modified by  Attila Gulyas on 2020.08.04

boolean Controls what happens to a calling (A) party when in a [bridge state](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Introduction/Life-Cycle-of-a-Call_1048888.mdx#0-about), and the called (B) party hangs up. If `true` the [dialplan](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/index.mdx#0-about) will stop processing, and the A leg will be terminated when the B leg terminates. If `false` (default) the dialplan continues to be processed after the B leg terminates. This is checked after [park\_after\_bridge](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#park_after_bridge) and [transfer\_after\_bridge](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#transfer_after_bridge).

The default value is `false` 

Usage

```xml
<action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
```
