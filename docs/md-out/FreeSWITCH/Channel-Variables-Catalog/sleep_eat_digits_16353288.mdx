## sleep_eat_digits

boolean When set to `true`, the sleep application will consume DTMFs which will, for example, prevent a caller from exiting out of an IVR. The default behavior is not to eat DTMF digits. This variable was added in SVN rev 14102.

![(attenzione)](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) this is a change in default behavior as the sleep application previously ate DTMFs without exception. Be sure to set `sleep_eat_digits` to `true` in order to preserve the previous behavior.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="sleep_eat_digits=true"/>
```
