## record_post_process_exec_app

string Executes an app for the purpose of postprocessing recorded audio. The reason this is required is if the A leg hangs up first in a call, the dialplan stops being processed, and then you aren't able to take action on the file that was recorded.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="record_post_process_exec_app=lua::vm_test.lua" />
```
