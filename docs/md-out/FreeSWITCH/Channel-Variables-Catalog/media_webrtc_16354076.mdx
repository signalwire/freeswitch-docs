## media_webrtc

boolean Used to instruct FS to generate an INVITE for a WebRTC call. For example, in case you need to originate a WebRTC call but you are not calling a SIP UA that is registered with FS (if the UA is registered with FS, FS knows it should originate a WebRTC call).

**Usage**

{media\_webrtc=true}
