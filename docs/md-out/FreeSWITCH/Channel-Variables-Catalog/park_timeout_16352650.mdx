## park_timeout

string When set, a parked call will disconnect after the timeout has occurred. Timeout is specified in seconds. If no `park_timeout` value is set then the parked call will be held indefinitely or until it is removed with a [uuid\_transfer](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_commands_1966741.mdx#uuid_transfer).

## **Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="park_timeout=30"/>
<action application="park"/>
```

You can also specify which [hangup\_cause](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#bridge_hangup_cause) you need when the channel is disconnected by `park_timeout`.

```xml
<action application="set" data="park_timeout=30:MEDIA_TIMEOUT"/>
```
