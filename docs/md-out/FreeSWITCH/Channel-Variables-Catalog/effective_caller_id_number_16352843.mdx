## effective_caller_id_number

string Sets the effective callerid number. This is automatically exported to the B-leg; however, it is not valid in an origination string. In other words, set this before calling bridge, otherwise use [origination\_caller\_id\_number](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#origination_caller_id_number).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=9185551212"/>
```
