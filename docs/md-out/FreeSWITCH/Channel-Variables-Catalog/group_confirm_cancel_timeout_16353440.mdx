## group_confirm_cancel_timeout

integer If set, cancels [leg\_timeout](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#leg_timeout) after the call is answered. [originate\_timeout](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#originate_timeout) still remains active.

When using group confirm, a call passes through three phases:

1. Call is ringing.
2. Call is answered, waiting to be confirmed.
3. Call is confirmed and bridged.

However, if you do

`<action application="set" data="group_confirm_cancel_timeout=1"/>`

then the timeout will only apply to phase 1\. So, once phase 1 is crossed, `leg_timeout` counter stops.
