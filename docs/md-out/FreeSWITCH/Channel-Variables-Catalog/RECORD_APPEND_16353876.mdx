## RECORD_APPEND

boolean Recording is appended to file. Set `RECORD_APPEND=true` on the channel and all recordings will behave this way to formats which support it (curently [mod\_sndfile](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_sndfile_32178375.mdx#-freeswitch--mod_sndfile-) for WAV, etc.)

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="RECORD_APPEND=true"/>
```
