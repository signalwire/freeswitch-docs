## hold_music

string Per-channel hold music. Supports all audio formats and audio streams. The `hold_music` variable can also be set globally in `vars.xml`.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="hold_music=/sounds/holdmusic.wav" />
```

```xml
<action application="set" data="hold_music=silence" />
```

You can also use `phrase:` to indicate to use a phrase instead of a specific file:

```xml
<action application="set" data="hold_music=phrase:my_hold_music" />
```

You can also set your `hold_music` to the special value `indicate_hold` instead of a music source and it will pass the hold signaling through to the far-end via the SDP:

```xml
<action application="set" data="hold_music=indicate_hold" />
```

For multi-tenant environment, if you want to have a separate MOH for the phone with hold button (like Polycom) that utilizes RE-INVITE with no media ip addr (0.0.0.0) for hold, you can override the hold-music values in the sip profile parameter similar to the following example:

```xml
<action application="bridge_export" data="hold_music=$${sounds_dir}/music/company-a.mp3"/>
```
