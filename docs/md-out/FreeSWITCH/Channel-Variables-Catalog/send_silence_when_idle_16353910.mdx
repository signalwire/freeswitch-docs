## send_silence_when_idle

string Intended for 1-leg calls, such as those terminating in an IVR menu or voice mail.

  
When greater than `0`, this variable tells FreeSWITCH to transmit comfort noise when idle. The value of this variable is set to the divisor of the silence generating function. `400` or `1400` are common values set, but you may experiment with other choices to pick one that sounds best.

When `true`, FreeSWITCH will pick a default comfort noise value.

When `-1`, FreeSWITCH will transmit silence without comfort noise.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="send_silence_when_idle=400"/>
```
