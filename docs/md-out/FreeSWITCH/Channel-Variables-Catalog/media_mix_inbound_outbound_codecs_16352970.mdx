## media_mix_inbound_outbound_codecs

boolean Set which list of codecs is offered to the B-leg.

FreeSWITCH used to take the codecs from the inbound A-leg and offer them out to the B-leg mixed with the configured list of outbound codecs. With large lists of codecs this can exceed the MTU of the UDP message and cause call setup failures.

As of [FS-8321](https://freeswitch.org/jira/browse/FS-8321?src=confmacro)  \-[Autentica](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/plugins/servlet/applinks/oauth/login-dance/authorize?applicationLinkID=c4b15fa3-ad57-3c05-af05-8c167cb92266) per visualizzare i dettagli del problema  the old behavior now requires the variable `media_mix_inbound_outbound_codecs=true` as the new default behavior is to offer the exact same codecs on the outbound B-leg that were offered on the inbound A-leg.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="media_mix_inbound_outbound_codecs=true"/>
```
