## playback_delimiter

string

  
When set, allows playback of multiple files in sequence, which are separated by the specified delimiter. 

Uses [mod\_dptools: file\_string](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod-dptools/6586646.mdx#0-about) internally.

  
### Usage

Setting `playback_delimiter` to the following:

```xml
<action application="set" data="playback_delimiter=&"/>
```

Permits the streaming of files `foo.wav` and `bar.wav` one right after the other:

```xml
<action application="playback" data="foo.wav&bar.wav"/>
```
