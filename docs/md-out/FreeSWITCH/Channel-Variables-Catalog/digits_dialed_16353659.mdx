## digits_dialed  
string

**Notes**

Seems to be the DTMF buffer, but only seems to be set on hangup. At least it only shows up in `CHANNEL_HANGUP` and `CHANNEL_HANGUP_COMPLETE` , but then all the entered DTMF digits are there.

TODO So where is the buffer, and how to access it and to flush it? (The latter may be important for a long running IVR).

UPDATE: it's not the DTMF buffer...
