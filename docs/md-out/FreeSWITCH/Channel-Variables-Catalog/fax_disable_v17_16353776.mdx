## fax_disable_v17

boolean `fax_disable_v17` prevents the use of the V.17 (9,600bps to 14,400bps) FAX modem. This means FAXes will be limited to the use of V.29 (9,600bps and 7,200bps) and V.27ter (4,800bps). Some VoIP systems handle V.17 so poorly there are often good reasons to want to disable the use of this modem.
