DID via SIP URI works. DID via SIP Trunk works. Outgoing works.

USERNAME is only the user part, it does not include the domain.

Note that for inbound calls, the call would normally hit the dialplan with destination\_number equal to the username. Setting extension to auto\_to\_user avoids this - the call will arrive with auto\_to\_user in the URI and Sofia will automatically take the destination\_number from the To header instead.

By default, NumberGroup supports G.711 A/U. To enable support for narrowband codecs like G.722, Speex and GSM, go to your Trunk configuration and change "Voice Compression" to "Yes".
