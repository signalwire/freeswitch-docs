### D-Link DIV-140

In general not very functional, with little technical support. Have never been able to actually dial out on the box, and there does not seem to be any way to have it automatically dial a call on a PSTN line. The documentation is quite terrible.

### D-Link DPH-150S

* **Registration**: work
* **Caller Id**: work
* **Call in/out**: work
* **Call waiting**: work
* **Transfer calls**: work
* **Park calls**: work

It is a great phone with a cool design. Althought it is a little hard to become familiar with function buttons. Setting up is very easy using web interface. For connecting to SIP provider use only WAN interface.
