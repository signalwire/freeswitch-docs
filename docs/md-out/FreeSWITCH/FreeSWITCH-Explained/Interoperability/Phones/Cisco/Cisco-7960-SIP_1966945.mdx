# About

This page discusses the Cisco 796x series phones when used with SIP signaling.

If you intend to use SCCP (skinny protocol) beware of the limitations in outbound dialing from Cisco phones as outlined in [FS-477](https://freeswitch.org/jira/browse/FS-477?src=confmacro)  \-[Autentica](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/plugins/servlet/applinks/oauth/login-dance/authorize?applicationLinkID=c4b15fa3-ad57-3c05-af05-8c167cb92266) per visualizzare i dettagli del problema

## **CISCO 7960 / 7960G LAB ENVIRONMENT:**

**Firmware Revisions:**

* **App Load:** P0S3-08-8-00
* **Boot Load:** PC030301
* **DSP Load:** 4.0(2.0)\[A0\]

**Also confirmed as working:**

* **App Load:** P0S3-08-11-00
* **Boot Load:** PC030301
* **DSP Load:** 4.0(5.0)\[A0\]

_**\*Note:**_ With previous revisions of the SIP Firmware for this phone it was discovered that NAT traversal was nearly impossible, and calls would mysteriously hang up after 120 seconds, etc.

Firmware Revision Warning

App Load: P0S3-08-11-00

This is confirmed as broken. Weird things happen with this firmware revision. Please consider using P0S3-08-8-00 until a fixed version is released.

Details: The bug in that version of Cisco firmware tends to create massive re-registration attempts, to the point that FS is so busy servicing the registration requests that it has no time to process incoming calls. When you have only a few phones it will handle this without much of a problem, but when you add more you'll notice one-way audio and dropped calls, adding yet more will create a situation whereby we've seen up to 25 seconds before an incoming call is even displayed on the CLI.

This was only noticed when multiple phones were pointed to a production FS instance since, with one phone configured, everything in the test lab worked.

Update 11/19/2008 - This was a compounded problem having to do with a linux kernel bug, and it corrupting the DBD Database in Freeswitch. Oddly enough, this didn't surface until the aforementioned Cisco firmware weirdness above. This bug seems to affect linux 2.6.28.10, but earlier and later versions may also be affected. The workaround was to put the Freeswitch SQLLite database in a RAM disk.

## **CISCO 7960 / 7960G PROVISIONING:**

ASSUMPTIONS:

This HowTo assumes that you have a TFTP Server, have a DHCP Server configured to point the DHCP client devices at the IP address of the TFTP server, and that the Cisco 7960 Firmware listed above is installed properly on the TFTP server. There are many howto's that discuss how to install and/or upgrade the SIP Firmware Images on the TFTP server, so this is not covered in this HowTo.

For ISC DHCPD, you will need to have this line:

```xml
option tftp-server-name "your.tftp.server.ip";
```

in your dhcpd.conf

If that option doesn't work, or doesn't exist, try consulting your tftp server documentation for "option 150".

**The Files:**

You will need a **SIPDefault.cnf** file that sets up reasonable defaults for phones, and you will need one file created per phone with the MAC Address of the phone embedded into the filename such as **SIP_0A0B0C0D0E0F_.cnf**

**The File Contents:**

The contents of the SIPDefault.cnf file are listed below as it appears on my server. You may wish to update some items such as the sntp\_server parameter and the date\_format parameter depending on where you are in the world and/or the telnet\_level depending on how secure you want things to be.

The auto\_answer parameter is a bitmap, and as set will set line 6 to be capable of answering the call automatically. This can be useful for an intercom and paging for instance.

The next file that needs to exist is the SIP&lt;macaddress>.cnf file where &lt;macaddress> is the hardware ethernet address of the phone itself. Hence: SIP00DEADBEEF00.cnf would pertain to a phone who's MAC Address is 00:DE:AD:BE:EF:00

You will need to replace host.domain.tld with the hostname or IP address of the SIP Profile you intend to use with the Cisco 7960's.

You will also need to replace the mysecret and 701X numbers with the credentials you created in the Freeswitch Directory. (more on that later).

The messages\_uri is where you would specify the number to be dialed in order to retrieve voice mail. This corresponds directly to the number dialed by pressing the messages button, or the envelope button on the (7960 / 7960G).

**\*\*Be Advised:** The demo dialplan that comes stock with freeswitch seems to expect the extensions to be 1XXX such as 1000, the configuration file below starts at 7010, and therefore you may need to make additional changes to the dialplan before you're able to call any of the provisioned lines on the phone.

## **BLIND XFER (Blind Transfer):**

While the attended transfer works. the blind transfer exhibited a problem when a call was placed to the telephone as an intercom call where the line was automatically answered.

In my defaut dialplan context I had to add this right at the top in order for the device to properly transfer calls that were placed to it's intercom line:

```xml
<extension name="Cisco Xfer Fix">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(auto-answer)$">
	<action application="set" data="destination_number=${sip_to_user}"/>
      </condition>
</extension>
```

## **Call Parking**

There doesn't seem to be a way to provision the bottom keys on the phone, so parking has been implemented as a blind transfer to a particular extension in my dial plan. Frankly I'm disappointed, but hey it's Cisco.

---

## **[Conferencing and Intercom](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Conferencing%5Fand%5FIntercom "Conferencing and Intercom")**

The Cisco 7960 and/or 7960G don't implement a multicast paging group, so there is no paging and intercom. See above link on how to implement it with unicast and a conference bridge.
