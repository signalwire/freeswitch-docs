# ClueCon Weekly Conference call 

 Created by  Belaid Areski, last modified by  Mitch Capper on 2021.10.06

# **Temporary Suspension of Weekly Conference Calls**

Previously weekly conference calls happened around FreeSWITCH development. Since the end of 2020 these were put on hold as most community members were unable to still make these calls. The below conference links / etc do not currently work given the weekly conference calls are not currently happening. 

  
# About

This is the main page for our weekly conference calls to help the FreeSWITCH project. Sub-projects like programming tasks and goals, documentation, and [janitorial](Contributing-Code/Janitorial-Tasks_3965753.mdx#-freeswitch--janitorial-tasks-) will be discussed.

Follow us on Twitter [@freeswitch](https://twitter.com/freeswitch) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/freeswitch) for the latest updates.

# Schedule

All public conference calls are hosted on the FreeSWITCH™ 888 conference bridge as listed below. Times listed are absolute times in the U.S. Central Time Zone, whether it is Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time. This means that UTC times will vary at different times of the year.

Muting

When you join you will initially be **muted** and need to press 0 if you wish to speak (this reduces background noise on the conference). Please remain muted unless you are actively conversing.

During the weekly ClueCon calls muting might be moderated during speaker presentations. Pressing 0 will put you in a queue to ask a question and you will be unmuted by the moderator when it's your turn to speak.

Be sure monitor IRC channel [#freeswitch](IRC_1970341.mdx#pb) on [irc.freenode.net](IRC_1970341.mdx#pb)! There are frequently related comments during the conference.

Conference Beeps

What are the Beeps in the conference?

* One high-pitched beep = someone has joined
* Two high-low beeps - someone has left
