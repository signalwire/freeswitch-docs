1. Auditing all Freeswitch modules and fix command and option help and auto complete
2. Fixing the Doxygen docs
3. Audit and compile list of clang(latest) compiler warnings(enabled with -Weverything) with which FS fails to build

Fix/Triage one of the issues reported by clang static analysis: <http://files.freeswitch.org/eg/clang-sa/>

Module requests:

mod\_hiredis -> replacement for mod\_redis which should use the system library of hiredis if available. Should also consider if there is any missing functionality that would be simple to add.
