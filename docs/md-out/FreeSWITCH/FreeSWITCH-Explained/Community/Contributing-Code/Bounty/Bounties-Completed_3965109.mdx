# Mod xml_cdr and xml_url : Extend mod_xml_curl to have an 'exec' protocol instead of http or https.

Example exec:/some/dir/file.php or anything else executable. It will pass the data via STDIN and expect the program to output STDOUT xml, which it will then process.

Bounty: $750; extra $500 ($1250 total) if completed before May 4th, 2009.

Bounty valid until: May 17th, 2009

Respond to: Bill Belanger - [wj.belanger@gmail.com](mailto:wj.belanger@gmail.com)

**2 Features required:**

1: Receive an event when a SIP INFO message is received

* Register for an event using event\_socket's **event** command
* Receive as an event through event\_socket the headers and data contained in the INFO message
* Optional - Supply a way to respond to received SIP INFOs with a 200-OK

2: Create and send a SIP INFO message using event\_socket

* Specify a framework to generate and send SIP INFO messages for an established call
* This framework must be able to accept custom headers, as well as data for the SIP INFO message
* Although not required, it is expected that this framework would be usable through event\_socket's **sendmsg** command
* It is required that whatever framework is used, it is accessible through event\_socket

If you decide to work on these features, please send a notification to Bill Belanger with an expected completion date.

# Provide a way to pass npdi, rn in tel URI when using SIP gateways

# mod for using new Javascript V8 Engine

**This is completed as of commit b762332 to git master, bounty paid in full**

Anthony said it would be far easier to use the same syntax/cpp wrapper as Lua, rather than trying to make it match spidermonkey.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8%5F%28JavaScript%5Fengine%29>

The performance would be at least better than mod\_spidermonkey but I don't know any more specifics. V8 is supposed to be incredibly fast.

On 2012-05-22 he said $10,000 or more could get it created.

&lt;@anthm>: AviMarcus, it would be above 10k probably  
&lt;@anthm>: that's a huge job  
&lt;@anthm>: i've examined that one before  
&lt;AviMarcus:> anthm, can you even estimate if it would give the same performance as lua?  
&lt;@anthm>: depending on what you did it would be in the neighborhood  
&lt;@anthm>: js is more complicated so there is more you can do wrong  
&lt;@anthm>: you can probably play with spidermonkey and assume its much better than that  
&lt;@anthm>: but it would be HUGE to try to emulate mod\_spidermonkey exactly, the only hope would be to try to get it more like mod\_lua so it could use the standard cpp wrapper  
&lt;@anthm>: it would be cool, maybe even fun but also hard as hell

If you're willing to chip in, please note it here:

* $200 Mark J Crane -- fusionpbx (2012-05-23) paid to Peter Olsson via paypal on 2014-01-15
