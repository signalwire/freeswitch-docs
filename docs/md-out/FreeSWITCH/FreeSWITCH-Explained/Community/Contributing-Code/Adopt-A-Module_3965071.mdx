# Modules Waiting for Adoption

List modules needing some love here:

* mod\_callcenter
* mod\_cidlookup
* mod\_distributor
* mod\_nibblebill
* mod\_opal
* mod\_lua

# Modules Off Limits

These modules will be maintained by the core developers...

* mod\_sofia
* mod\_conference

# FAQ

## Can a module be adopted by more than one person?

Yes. Some of the larger modules like mod\_callcenter are going to require this. It just takes too much time and energy for one person to take care of. As a team, you need to coordinate amongst yourselves to figure out what needs to be documented, what bugs need to be fixed, etc.

## What happens if I can no longer maintain a module?

* If you are working in a team, bring it up with them and let them know what's going on.
* Remove your name from this page.
* If you are the only one maintaining a module, let one of the core developers know.
* send out an email to the mailing list, and try to ask if someone can take it over.
