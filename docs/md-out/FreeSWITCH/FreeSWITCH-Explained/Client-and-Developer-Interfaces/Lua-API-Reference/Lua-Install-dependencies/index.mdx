# Lua Install dependencies

# About

When using Lua to build IVR applications or serving configurations, you would likely need to install some dependencies. This page contains some of the most common dependencies.

# Lua Deps List

* Installing LuaSQL - [Installing LuaSQL](./Installing-LuaSQL_3965269.mdx#odbc)
* Installing LuaSocket - [Installing LuaSocket](./Installing-LuaSocket_3965256.mdx#-freeswitch--installing-luasocket-)

# Package Paths

Some Lua packages installed via _apt-get_, _yum_, _rpms_, (or other package managers) might be installed in places that aren't in the default Lua package search path. If you encounter an error while trying to _require_ a new library, like this...

```xml
2016-12-29 21:56:45.507805 [ERR] mod_lua.cpp:203 /var/fs/scripts/somescript.lua:1: module 'somelibrary.lua' not found:
        no field package.preload['somelibrary.lua']
        no file '/var/fs/scripts/somelibrary/lua.lua'
        no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/somelibrary/lua.so'
        no file '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.2/somelibrary/lua.so'
        no file '/usr/lib/lua/5.2/somelibrary/lua.so'
        no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/loadall.so'
        no file './somelibrary/lua.so'
        no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/somelibrary.so'
        no file '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.2/somelibrary.so'
        no file '/usr/lib/lua/5.2/somelibrary.so'
        no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/loadall.so'
        no file './somelibrary.so'


```

... then you may have to append to Lua's default package search path. 

You can add arbitrary paths to Lua's package search path as follows:

```xml
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. [[/usr/share/lua/5.2/?.lua]]
```

Simply add that line to the top of your Lua script before requiring anything.
