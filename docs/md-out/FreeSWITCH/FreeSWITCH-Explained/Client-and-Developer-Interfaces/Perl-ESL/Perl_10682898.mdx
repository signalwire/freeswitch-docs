# About

In FreeSWITCH, there are many ways to use Perl, not all of which require the mod\_perl module or the CPAN Perl modules. You can use Perl in the following ways with FreeSWITCH:

* Executing Perl scripts via curl, etc. to return XML configuration (only requires the curl module)
* Socket control / event socket interaction (send and receive events, execute commands, and IVR over socket interaction) through [Perl ESL](./index.mdx#about); this does not require mod\_perl, only the Perl ESL module.
* Application action / standard execution to carry out a dialplan (requires mod\_perl)
* Native XML generation (requires mod\_perl)

If you want or need the advanced control that mod\_perl provides please see the [mod\_perl](../../Modules/mod_perl_1048930.mdx#about) page for the full documentation on it.

# Build/Install

There is no one way to install Perl support. As outlined above you can use Perl many different ways, each having different requirements. See the [mod\_perl](../../Modules/mod_perl_1048930.mdx#about) page for building mod\_perl.

# Execution of a script

DEPRECATED

You can run scripts directly from the console with:

perlrun /path/to/your/script.pl

If you just want to run a perl script (or any normal application) from a dialplan, invoke the system app:

&lt;action application="system" data="/path/to/app.pl"/>

Note: FreeSWITCH™ has a "scripts" directory which can be determined from the console via the command:

eval $${script_dir}

You must specify either 

$${script_dir}/my_script.pl

or the full absolute path to your script when you invoke it from the dialplan.  

# Example Scripts
