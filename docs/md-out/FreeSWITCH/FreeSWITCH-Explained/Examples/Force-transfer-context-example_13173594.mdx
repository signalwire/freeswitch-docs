## Example: Making a transfer-handling context

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--
    This context is designed only to be accessed by channels which are bridged and receive a
    transfer/REFER.  The force_transfer_context channel variable is set prior to executing a
    bridge so that the channel's ROUTING state will process this context for handling a transfer/REFER.

    This context is NOT designed to be associated with any SIP profile.  If that is maintained, no call sent to
    this box can directly access this context (at least that is one way to implement this).
    
    When a channel performs a bridge in another context (e.g. the default context), do your bridge something like this:
    <action application="set" data="force_transfer_context=transfer_handler"/>
    <action application="bridge" data="YOUR DESTINATION!!!"/>
    
    However, BEWARE!!!  Leaving force_transfer_context set to this context will affect ANY transfer of a channel
    for the time that force_transfer_context is set.
    
    So, for example, if you have some kind of continuation after a bridge, you may want to do something like:
    
    <action application="set" data="force_transfer_context=transfer_handler"/>
    <action application="bridge" data="YOUR DESTINATION!!!"/>
    <action application="unset" data="force_transfer_context"/>
