As of December 31, 2018, FreeSWITCH is longer tested on OS X El Capitan. Apple dropped support and no longer issues security patches. Also, Homebrew no longer officially supports El Capitan.

FreeSWITCH installed and worked fine on El Capitan as of the dates below. To install, follow the [manual installation](../macOS-Installation/macOS-Manual-Installation_13174557.mdx#installation-directories) instructions.

## Download Xcode (No Longer Required as of December 2017)

Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer.

This Xcode Download requires you to sign in with your Apple ID and agree to the Software Agreement:  
El Capitan 10.11: download and install Xcode 7.3.1 from [Xcode 7.3.1 Download](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer%5FTools/Xcode%5F7.3.1/Xcode%5F7.3.1.dmg) then start Xcode. NOTE: Xcode 8 CANNOT be used. See [FS-9521](https://freeswitch.org/jira/browse/FS-9521).

For OS X 10.11 and 10.12: NEVER delete the /usr/local directory! It's very difficult to recreate, it must be restored from a backup. This is due to [System Integrity Protection (aka rootless)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System%5FIntegrity%5FProtection) security.

As of July 17, 2016, the page below is no longer maintained by the original author and is marked as archived. It is replaced by these instructions: [macOS Developer Tools](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#installation-methods).

# About

This is part of the [macOS Installation](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#about) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of components that may be unique to OS X 10.11**.**

# OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode 7](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), [Clang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites. The Command Line Tools are included and automatically installed with Xcode. The Apple Developer site offers the **standalone CLT** but it _**cannot be used because Homebrew will not install without the** **Xcode/CLT version.**_

## Install Xcode

Install Xcode using the [OS X App Store application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) or download it from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the CLT in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_
