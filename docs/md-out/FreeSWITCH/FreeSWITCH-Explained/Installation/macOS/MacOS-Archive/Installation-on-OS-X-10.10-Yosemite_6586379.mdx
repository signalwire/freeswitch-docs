As of December 31, 2017, FreeSWITCH is longer tested on OS X Yosemite. Apple dropped support and no longer issues security patches. Also, Homebrew no longer officially supports Yosemite.

FreeSWITCH installed and worked on Yosemite as of the dates below. Add the "Create /usr/local Subdirectory" instructions below to the [manual installation](../macOS-Installation/macOS-Manual-Installation_13174557.mdx#installation-directories) instructions.

## Create /usr/local Subdirectory

In OS X 10.10 Yosemite /usr/local is not supplied so it must be created by running the following commands in Terminal, sudo will prompt for the administrator password:

```xml
  cd /usr
  sudo mkdir local                          # Create the /usr/local directory
```

## Download Xcode (No Longer Required as of December 2017)

Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer.

This Xcode Download requires you to sign in with your Apple ID and agree to the Software Agreement:  
Yosemite 10.10: download and install Xcode 7.2.1 from [Xcode 7.2.1 Download](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer%5FTools/Xcode%5F7.2.1/Xcode%5F7.2.1.dmg) then start Xcode. Perform [Rename Xcode Directory (As of Xcode 7.1)](Installation-on-OS-X-10.10-Yosemite_6586379.mdx#rename-xcode-directory-as-of-xcode-71).

As of July 17, 2016, the page below is no longer maintained by the original author and is marked as archived. It is replaced by these instructions: [macOS Developer Tools](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#installation-methods).

# About

This is part of the [macOS Installation](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#about) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of components that may be unique to OS X 10.10**.**

# OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode 7](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), [Clang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites. The Command Line Tools are included and automatically installed with Xcode. The Apple Developer site offers the **standalone CLT** but it _**cannot be used because Homebrew will not install without the** **Xcode/CLT version.**_

## Install Xcode 7.2

Xcode 7.2 is no longer available from the [OS X App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) so must be downloaded from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the CLT in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_

## Rename Xcode Directory (As of Xcode 7.1)

The command line tools installed by Xcode 7 are for OS X 10.11, these tools work fine on OS X 10.10\. However, Homebrew checks for the 10.10 version if running under OS X 10.10\. If it does not find them it prompts you to install them separately. That is not required if you rename (a rename is required as an alias does not work) the command line tools directory as follows:

1. Open the Applications folder and select Xcode.
2. Control+click Xcode to reveal the contextual menu and select Show Package Contents.
3. Navigate to: Contents –> Developer –> Platforms –> MacOSX.platform –> Developer –> SDKs –> MacOSX10.11.sdk
4. Select MacOSX10.11.sdk and press Enter
5. Change the 10.11 to 10.10 and press Enter. The directory name must be MacOSX10.10.sdk
