## Scheduled hangup dialplan application

```xml
<action application="sched_hangup" data="+10 normal_clearing bleg"/>
```

* The cause code is optional and the optional bleg keyword will only hangup the channel the current channel is bridged to if the call is in a bridge.

## Scheduled hangup API function

```xml
sched_hangup +10 <uuid_string> normal_clearing
```

* The cause code is optional

## Scheduled transfer dialplan application

```xml
<action application="sched_transfer" data="+10 1000 XML default"/>
```

* The last 2 args (dialplan and context) are optional

## Scheduled transfer API function

```xml
sched_transfer +10 <uuid_string> 1000 XML default
```

* The last 2 args (dialplan and context) are optional

## Scheduled broadcast dialplan application

```xml
<action application="sched_broadcast" data="+10 playback::/tmp/foo.wav"/> 
<action application="sched_broadcast" data="+10 playback::/tmp/foo.wav bleg"/> 
<action application="sched_broadcast" data="+10 playback::/tmp/foo.wav both"/> 
<action application="sched_broadcast" data="+10 playback!normal_clearing::/tmp/foo.wav"/>
<action application="sched_broadcast" data="+10 phrase::warning"/> 
<action application="sched_broadcast" data="+10 phrase!normal_clearing::goodbye"/> 
```

* The optional !&lt;cause\_code> can be added to make the channel hangup after broadcasting the file.
* The optional bleg/both parameter specifies which leg of the call to broadcast the file on. If not specified, the broadcast only occurs on the a-leg.

## Scheduled broadcast API function

```xml
sched_broadcast +10 <uuid_str> playback::/tmp/foo.wav 
sched_broadcast +10 <uuid_str> playback::/tmp/foo.wav bleg
sched_broadcast +10 <uuid_str> playback::/tmp/foo.wav both
sched_broadcast +10 <uuid_str> playback!normal_clearing::/tmp/foo.wav 
```

* The optional !&lt;cause\_code> can be added to make the channel hangup after broadcasting the file.
* The option bleg/both parameter specifies which leg of the call to broadcast the file on. If not specified, the broadcast only occurs on the a-leg.

Note: The new C functions in the core are documented in the Doxygen.
