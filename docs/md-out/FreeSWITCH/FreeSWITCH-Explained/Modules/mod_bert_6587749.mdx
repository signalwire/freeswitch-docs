# About

**mod\_bert** provides **bert\_test**, an application that generates and captures a milliwatt tone and prints an error rate at the end. It also provides ESL events that can be used to load-test equipment and detect if there are audio gaps in some of the sessions. It only works with the PCMU codec.

# Description

Note that **mod\_bert** is pretty naive: no real audio analysis is done beyond verifying the milliwatt PCMU sequence is received on each end (with the configured error tolerance). This means any kind of gain control, echo cancellation, etc. most likely will break the results.

You typically want to call the **bert\_test** application on both ends of the call. You can also call bert on one end of the call and **echo** or **delay\_echo** on the other end.

FreeSWITCH mod\_bert &lt;-----------> DUT &lt;-------------> FreeSWITCH mod\_bert or echo

FreeSWITCH mod\_bert &lt;-----------> (DUT in echo mode)

(DUT: Device under test)

The DUT can be either another FreeSWITCH instance or any other VoIP equipment (remember, no echo cancellation or AGC must be enabled in that system)

Most of the variables you see below are optional.

* **bert\_timeout\_ms** is number of milliseconds before timing out trying to find the bit pattern that the application transmits (milliwatt).
* **bert\_window\_ms** is number of milliseconds of the audio analysis window (each x milliseconds verifies how many errors have occurred, etc).
* **bert\_max\_err** is the max number of allowed errors once the audio stream is in "sync".
* **bert\_timer=soft** tells the application to use FreeSWITCH core soft timer instead of timing transmission based on reception of packets (this should probably be default).
* **bert\_hangup\_on\_error** will hangup the call when audio errors occur.
* **bert\_debug\_io\_file** is for debugging the rx/tx audio.

  
Usage Example

```xml
<extension name="bert_test">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^bert_test$">
    <action application="set" data="bert_timeout_ms=5000"/>
    <action application="set" data="bert_window_ms=1000"/>
    <action application="set" data="bert_max_err=10"/>
    <action application="set" data="bert_timer=soft"/>
    <!--<action application="set" data="bert_hangup_on_error=yes"/>-->
    <!--<action application="set" data="bert_debug_io_file=/tmp/bert_debug_${uuid}"/>-->
    <action application="set" data="jitterbuffer_msec=100:200:40"/>
    <action application="answer"/>
    <action application="bert_test" />
  </condition>
</extension>
```
