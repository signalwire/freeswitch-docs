0\. About

[mod\_event\_socket](./mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) is a TCP-based interface to control FreeSWITCH, and it operates in two modes, **inbound** and **outbound**. (These terms are relative to FreeSWITCH).

By default, connections are only allowed from `localhost`, but this can be changed via configuration files (see **Configuration** section below for details). 

## 1\. Configuration

First enable the [mod\_event\_socket](./mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) module in `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/`[modules.conf.xml](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/a5cecbfc2a5e0ea2d3f45489f2681a67e32ce955/conf/vanilla/autoload%5Fconfigs/modules.conf.xml) by removing the comment marks (`<!--` and `-->` ).

Enabled by default

[mod\_event\_socket](./mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) is enabled by default for installations with [vanilla configuration](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/a5cecbfc2a5e0ea2d3f45489f2681a67e32ce955/conf/vanilla/) (i.e., when compiled from source or installed via package managers).

Find the location of &lt;conf\_dir>

To get the location of `<conf_dir>` , use **`eval $${conf_dir}`** in [fs\_cli](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx#or) or `fs_cli -x 'eval $${conf_dir}'` on your terminal.

See [Command-Line Interface (fs\_cli)](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx#or) and the available configuration options.

TODO There is no real link for configuration options - the closest would be [Global Variables](../Introduction/Variables/Global-Variables_13173994.mdx#about) (which is just a list) and [Default Configuration](../Configuration/Default-Configuration_6587388.mdx#mod_vp8) (which only implicitly defines `conf_dir` ). So update them.

The default [mod\_event\_socket](./mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) configuration binds to `::` (i.e., to listen to connections from **any** host), which will work on IPv4 or IPv6\. 

`::` means that [mod\_event\_socket](./mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) will listen to connections from **any** host (see vanilla `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/[event_socket.conf.xml](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/a5cecbfc2a5e0ea2d3f45489f2681a67e32ce955/conf/vanilla/autoload%5Fconfigs/event%5Fsocket.conf.xml)` configuration file in the [SignalWire GitHub repository](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch)). **There are obvious security risks**, so one would want to change this (e.g., to localhost only, `::1` ), and perhaps also limit access via a firewall and/or [ACL](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/ACL "ACL"), as well as never using the default password.

```xml
<configuration name="event_socket.conf" description="Socket Client">
  <settings>
    <!-- Allow socket connections from any host -->
    <!-- :: is the IPv6 version of 0.0.0.0 in IPv4 -->
    <param name="listen-ip" value="::"/>
    <param name="listen-port" value="8021"/>
    <param name="password" value="ClueCon"/>
  </settings>
</configuration>
```

To change the default behaviour, use the `listen-ip` parameter. For example, to allow connections from localhost only:

```xml
<configuration name="event_socket.conf" description="Socket Client">
  <settings>
    <param name="nat-map" value="false"/>
    <!-- ::1 is the IPv6 version of 127.0.0.0/8 in IPv4 -->
    <param name="listen-ip" value="::1"/>
    <param name="listen-port" value="8021"/>
    <param name="password" value="ClueCon"/>
    <!--<param name="apply-inbound-acl" value="loopback.auto"/>-->
    <!--<param name="stop-on-bind-error" value="true"/>-->
  </settings>
</configuration>
```

IPv6 support

You can listen on IPv6 addresses (with the `listen-ip` parameter) since [revision 8c794ac](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/commit/8c794ac).

For example, the above example using `::` (IPv6 equivalent of 0.0.0.0) will enable listening on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on dual stack hosts.

### 1.1 ACL

Using [Access Control List (ACL)](../Networking/3965687.mdx#-acl-)s is recommended for enhanced security if you allow ESL connections from another machine. One can either enable named [Access Control List (ACL)](../Networking/3965687.mdx#-acl-)s (defined in `<conf_dir>/autoload_configs/[acl.conf.xml](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/a5cecbfc2a5e0ea2d3f45489f2681a67e32ce955/conf/vanilla/autoload%5Fconfigs/acl.conf.xml)`) or allow IP ranges directly in [event\_socket.conf.xml](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/a5cecbfc2a5e0ea2d3f45489f2681a67e32ce955/conf/vanilla/autoload%5Fconfigs/event%5Fsocket.conf.xml):

**Syntax**

```xml
<param name="apply-inbound-acl" value="<acl_list|cidr>"/>
```

  
**Examples**

```xml
<param name="apply-inbound-acl" value="10.20.0.0/16"/>
<param name="apply-inbound-acl" value="loopback.auto"/>
```

  
Multiple `apply-inbound-acl` params will **not** work.

As of 1.6 you must supply an ACL. In order to allow all IPs you can use `**any_v4.auto** `in [event\_socket.conf.xml](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/a5cecbfc2a5e0ea2d3f45489f2681a67e32ce955/conf/vanilla/autoload%5Fconfigs/event%5Fsocket.conf.xml).

### 1.2 nat-map

nat-map will try to use uPNP or PMP to tell your router to allow inbound connections to the specified port if the router supports dynamic port mapping. 

This was useful when the router sat behind a firewall on an RFC1918 address and you wanted to pass port 8021 from your public i.p. down to your FreeSWITCH. When nat-map is enabled it will ping the router with the NAT mapping protocol and, if it supports it, will configure itself for you on demand. This is not recommended in modern installations.

## 2\. Modes of operation

### 2.1 Inbound mode

Inbound mode means you run your applications (in whatever languages) as clients, and connect to the FreeSWITCH server to invoke commands and control FreeSWITCH.

```xml
    ********************************************
    *                     |                    *
    *  FreeSWITCH™        |  mod_event_socket  *
    *                     |  127.0.0.1:8021    *
    *                     |                    *
    ********************************************
              /\                 /\             
              /                   \             
       ******************       ******************
       * Client A       *       * Client B       *
       * 127.0.0.1:9988 *       * 127.0.0.1:9999 *
       ******************       ******************
```

  
In inbound mode, your application (Client A: Python, Client B: Perl, etc.) connects to the FreeSWITCH™ server on the given port and sends commands, as shown in the above diagram. The rest of this document is biased toward this inbound mode, though there is a lot of overlap with outbound mode. Using inbound socket connections you can check status, make outbound calls, etc.

If you would like to handle incoming calls using inbound mode, you should add the `uuid_park` command (see [mod\_commands](./mod_commands_1966741.mdx#--)) to your dialplan. Otherwise the dialplan might complete executing before your client can send commands to the event socket.

### 2.2 Outbound mode

Outbound mode means you make a daemon (with whatever language), and then have FreeSWITCH connect to it. You add an extension to the dialplan, and put &lt;action application="socket" data="[ip:port](http://ipport) sync full"/> and create a script that runs on that [ip:port](http://ipport) and answer, playback and everything else you need on the script. Since revision git-8c794ac on 14/03/2012 you can connect to IPv6 addresses. When using IPv6 addresses the port parameter is required: &lt;action application="socket" data="::1:8021"/> connects to ::1 on port 8021\. Since this revision hostnames resolving to IPv6 addresses can be used.

In outbound mode, also known as the "socket application" (or socket client), FreeSWITCH™ makes outbound connections to another process (similar to Asterisk's FAGI model). Using outbound connections you can have FreeSWITCH™ call your own application(s) when particular events occur. See [Event Socket Outbound](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/Event-Socket-Outbound_3375460.mdx#faq) for more details regarding things specific to outbound mode.

## 3\. Command Documentation

The following section aims at documenting all commands that can be sent. This section is a work in progress.

### 3.1 api

Send a [FreeSWITCH API](../Introduction/FreeSWITCH-API_30867723.mdx#-freeswitch--freeswitch-api-) command, **blocking mode**. That is, the FreeSWITCH instance won't accept any new commands until the `api` command finished execution.

**Usage**

```xml
api <command> <arg>
```

  
**Examples**

```xml
api originate sofia/mydomain.com/ext@yourvsp.com 1000   # connect sip:ext@yourvsp.com to extension 1000
api msleep 5000
```

### 3.2 bgapi

Send a [FreeSWITCH API](../Introduction/FreeSWITCH-API_30867723.mdx#-freeswitch--freeswitch-api-) command, **non-blocking mode**. This will let you execute a job in the background, and the result will be sent as an event with an indicated UUID to match the reply to the command.

**Usage**

```xml
bgapi <command> <arg>
```

The same API commands available as with the `api` command, however the server returns immediately and is available for processing more commands.

Example return value:

```xml
Content-Type: command/reply
Reply-Text: +OK Job-UUID: c7709e9c-1517-11dc-842a-d3a3942d3d63
```

When the command is done executing, FreeSWITCH fires an event with the result and you can compare that to the Job-UUID to see what the result was. In order to receive this event, you will need to subscribe to [BACKGROUND_JOB](../Introduction/Event-System/Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) events.

If you want to set your own custom Job-UUID over plain socket:

```xml
bgapi status
Job-UUID: d8c7f660-37a6-4e73-9170-1a731c442148
```

Reply:

```xml
Content-Type: command/reply
Reply-Text: +OK Job-UUID: d8c7f660-37a6-4e73-9170-1a731c442148
Job-UUID: d8c7f660-37a6-4e73-9170-1a731c442148
```

### 3.3 linger

Tells FreeSWITCH not to close the socket connection when a channel hangs up. Instead, it keeps the socket connection open until the last event related to the channel has been received by the socket client.

**Usage**

```xml
linger
```

### 3.4 nolinger

Disable socket lingering. See **linger** above.

**Usage**

```xml
nolinger
```

### 3.5 event

The `event` command is used to subscribe on [events from FreeSWITCH](../Introduction/Event-System/index.mdx#0-about) (plain text, XML, or JSON output format)

**Usage**

```xml
event plain <list of events to log or all>
event xml <list of events to log or all>
event json <list of events to log or all>
```

You may specify any number events on the same line that should be separated with spaces. 

See [Event List](../Introduction/Event-System/Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) page for a comprehensive list of events.

  
**Examples**

```xml
event plain ALL
event plain CHANNEL_CREATE CHANNEL_DESTROY CUSTOM conference::maintenance sofia::register sofia::expire
event xml ALL
event json CHANNEL_ANSWER
```

**Subsequent calls to `event` won't override the previous event sets**. Supposing, you've first registered for `DTMF`,

```xml
event plain DTMF
```

but you want to register for `CHANNEL_ANSWER` also, then it is enough to do

```xml
event plain CHANNEL_ANSWER
```

and you will continue to receive `DTMF` along with `CHANNEL_ANSWER`.

#### 3.5.1 `event plain` format

[Events](../Introduction/Event-System/Events_32178330.mdx#0-about) consist of

* a **header section**, and
* an optional **event body**.

##### 3.5.1.1 Header section

Headers are key/value pairs separated by a colon, and headers are separated by 1 line feed.

Some header values may contain multiple line breaks, but because FreeSWITCH URL-encodes all of them, these multi-line header values will still appear as 1 line.

**Example of multi-line header values** Espandi fonte 

```xml
# header BEFORE URL-encoding
variable_switch_r_sdp: v=0
o=UAC 6407 6867 IN IP4 192.168.27.72
s=SIP Media Capabilities
c=IN IP4 61.231.8.102
t=0 0
m=audio 12916 RTP/AVP 0 18 101
a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
a=rtpmap:18 G729/8000
a=fmtp:18 annexb=no
a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000
a=fmtp:101 0-15
a=maxptime:20

# header AFTER URL-encoding
variable_switch_r_sdp: v%3D0%0D%0Ao%3DUAC%206407%206867%20IN%20IP4%20192.168.27.72%0D%0As%3DSIP%20Media%20Capabilities%0D%0Ac%3DIN%20IP4%2061.231.8.102%0D%0At%3D0%200%0D%0Am%3Daudio%2012916%20RTP/AVP%200%2018%20101%0D%0Aa%3Drtpmap%3A0%20PCMU/8000%0D%0Aa%3Drtpmap%3A18%20G729/8000%0D%0Aa%3Dfmtp%3A18%20annexb%3Dno%0D%0Aa%3Drtpmap%3A101%20telephone-event/8000%0D%0Aa%3Dfmtp%3A101%200-15%0D%0Aa%3Dmaxptime%3A20%0D%0A

```

##### 3.5.1.2 Event body

Events may have a body, carrying additional content generated with the event. It is usually not in the key/value form of headers, and may contain its own native formatting. 

The presence of `Content-Length` in the **header section** is an indicator that there is an **event body**. The value of the `Content-Length` header is the size of the **body** in bytes.

**(e.g., DETECTED\_SPEECH event example from Event List page**

```xml

#### 3.5.2 `event plain` parsing instructions

1. **Look for 2 line feeds** or end-of-line sequences(EOL)  
TODO The original text contains LF, the FreeSWITCH book says CRLF. Figure out which is correct.
2. **Get the event data**  
Read exactly as many bytes from the socket as specified in the `Content-Length` header  
Note that since this is TCP, this may take more than one read so if you are supposed to read 200 bytes and the next read only returns 50, you must continue to read another 150, and so on until you have read 200 bytes or the socket has an error.  
Once you have read all the bytes in the `Content-Length` header, the next packet will start on the subsequent byte.
3. **Parse event data**  
Is the `Content-Length` header among the event headers? (Implying that there is an event body.)  
   1. **No** → All done.  
   2. **Yes** →  
         1. Evaluate `Content-Length` value  
         2. Read that many bytes  
         `Content-Length` is the length of the event (in bytes) beginning **AFTER** the double LF line ("\\n\\n") of the event header.

#### 3.5.3 Special Cases

##### 3.5.3.1 myevents

The 'myevents' subscription allows your inbound socket connection to behave like an outbound socket connect. It will "lock on" to the events for a particular uuid and will ignore all other events, closing the socket when the channel goes away or closing the channel when the socket disconnects and all applications have finished executing.

**Usage**

```xml
myevents <uuid>
```

Once the socket connection has locked on to the events for this particular uuid it will NEVER see any events that are not related to the channel, even if subsequent **event** commands are sent. If you need to monitor a specific channel/uuid _and_ you need watch for other events as well then it is best to use a filter.

You can also set the event format (plain, xml or json):

**Usage**

```xml
myevents plain <uuid>
myevents json <uuid>
myevents xml <uuid>
```

The default format is plain.

##### 3.5.3.2 divert_events

The divert\_events switch is available to allow events that an embedded script would expect to get in the inputcallback to be diverted to the event socket.

**Examples**

```xml
divert_events on
divert_events off
```

An inputcallback can be registered in an embedded script using setInputCallback(). Setting divert\_events to "on" can be used for chat messages like gtalk channel, ASR events and others.

### 3.6 filter

Specify event types to listen for. Note, this is not a filter out but rather a "filter in," that is, when a filter is applied only the filtered values are received. Multiple filters on a socket connection are allowed.

**Usage**

```xml
filter <EventHeader> <ValueToFilter>
```

Example:

The following example will subscribe to all events and then create two filters, one to listen for HEARTBEATS and one to listen for CHANNEL\_EXECUTE events.

```xml
  events plain all

  Content-Type: command/reply
  Reply-Text: +OK event listener enabled plain


  filter Event-Name CHANNEL_EXECUTE

  Content-Type: command/reply
  Reply-Text: +OK filter added. [filter]=[Event-Name CHANNEL_EXECUTE]


  filter Event-Name HEARTBEAT

  Content-Type: command/reply
  Reply-Text: +OK filter added. [Event-Name]=[HEARTBEAT]

```

Now only HEARTBEAT and CHANNEL\_EXECUTE events will be received. You can filter on any of the event headers. To filter for a specific channel you will need to use the uuid:

  filter Unique-ID d29a070f-40ff-43d8-8b9d-d369b2389dfe 

This method is an alternative to the [myevents](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod%5Fevent%5Fsocket#Special%5FCase%5F-%5F.27myevents.27 "Mod event socket") event type. If you need _only_ the events for a specific channel then use **myevents**, otherwise use a combination of filters to narrow down the events you wish to receive on the socket.

To filter multiple unique IDs, you can just add another filter for events for each UUID. This can be useful for example if you want to receive start/stop-talking events for multiple users on a particular conference. ``

  filter plain all
  filter plain CUSTOM conference::maintenance
  filter Unique-ID $participantB
  filter Unique-ID $participantA
  filter Unique-ID $participantC

  
This will give you events for Participant A,B and C on any conference. To receive events for all users on a conference you can use something like:`filter Conference-Unique-ID $ConfUUID`

You can filter on any of the parameters you get in a freeSWITCH event:

  filter plain all
  filter call-direction Inbound
  filter Event-Calling-File mod_conference.c
  filter Conference-Unique-ID $ConfUUID

You can use them individually or compound them depending on whatever end result you desire for the type of events you want to receive

### 3.7 filter delete

Specify the events which you want to revoke the filter. filter delete can be used when some filters are applied wrongly or when there is no use of the filter.

Usage:

  filter delete &lt;EventHeader> &lt;ValueToFilter>

Example:

  filter delete Event-Name HEARTBEAT

Now, you will no longer receive HEARTBEAT events. You can delete any filter that is applied by this way.

  filter delete Unique-ID d29a070f-40ff-43d8-8b9d-d369b2389dfe

This is to delete the filter which is applied for the given unique-id. After this, you won't receive any events for this unique-id.

  filter delete Unique-ID

This deletes all the filters which are applied based on the unique-id.

### 3.8 sendevent

Send an event into the event system (multi line input for headers).

```xml
sendevent <event-name>
<headers>

<body>
```

Some phones require authentication for NOTIFY requests. FreeSWITCH can respond to a digest challenge if reverse authentication credentials are supplied for the user. See [XML User Directory](../Directory/XML-User-Directory/index.mdx#about).

Uncategorized content

I've not found any documentation of any additional event headers, hopefully someone else with add that information. The events themselves can be found here: [Event List](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event%5FList "Event List")

sendevent CHANNEL_HANGUP

Something that was undocumented but is supported; SIP INFO messages can be sent to every IP you need.

```xml
sendevent SEND_INFO
profile: external
content-type: text/plain
to-uri: sip:1@2.3.4.5
from-uri: sip:1@1.2.3.4
content-length: 15

test
```

3.8.1 Examples

##### 3.8.1.1 Switch phone MWI led (tested on yealink)

For [MWI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message%5FWaiting%5FIndicator) you make the FreeSWITCH event SWITCH\_EVENT\_MESSAGE\_WAITING with headers:

MWI-Messages-Waiting (yes/no)
MWI-Message-Account &lt;any sip url you want>
MWI-Voice-Message x/y (a/b)
read/unread (urgent read/urgent unread)

No Message:

**MWI No Message**

```xml
sendevent  message_waiting
MWI-Messages-Waiting: no
MWI-Message-Account: sip:user1@192.168.1.14
```

Some Message:

**MWI With Message**

```xml
sendevent  message_waiting
MWI-Messages-Waiting: yes
MWI-Message-Account: sip:user1@192.168.1.14
MWI-Voice-Message: 0/1 (0/0)
```

##### 3.8.1.2 Make Snom phones reread their settings from the settings server

**Snom NOTIFY**

```xml
sendevent NOTIFY
profile: internal
event-string: check-sync;reboot=false
user: 1000
host: 192.168.10.4
content-type: application/simple-message-summary
```

##### 3.8.1.3 `sendevent` examples with a message body

The length of the body is specified by the `Content-Length` header.

```xml
sendevent NOTIFY
profile: internal
content-type: application/simple-message-summary
event-string: check-sync
user: 1005
host: 192.168.10.4

or

**Send Message**

```xml
sendevent SEND_MESSAGE
profile: internal
content-length: 2
content-type: text/plain
user: 1005
host: 99.157.44.194

OK
```

Results in a packet like this:

##### **3.8.1.4 SIP Proxy Example** 

To send through a proxy, use the event headers: contact-uri, to-uri, and from-uri  
In this example, the SIP proxy is 192.168.207.156:5060 and the UA can be reached at 1002@192.168.0.99:11710

```xml
sendevent NOTIFY
profile: internal
content-type: application/simple-message-summary
event-string: check-sync
user: 1002
host: 3.local
to-uri: 1002@3.local

* If 'Auth Resync-Reboot' is set to yes (default) in the phone than you have to specify the `reverse-auth-user` and `reverse-auth-pass` fields
* If you only put '`event-string: resync`' in the body then the unit will use its stored profile URI

##### 3.8.1.6 Example usage for CSTA event:

**CSTA Event**

```xml
sendevent SWITCH_EVENT_PHONE_FEATURE
profile: internal
user: ex1004
host: 3.local
device: ex1004
Feature-Event: DoNotDisturbEvent
doNotDisturbOn: on
```

##### 3.8.1.7 Display a text message on a Snom 370 or Snom 820

The message must be of type "text/plain".

### `3.9 sendmsg`

**Usage**

```xml
sendmsg <UUID>
<headers>

<body>
```

`sendmsg` is used to control the behavior of FreeSWITCH. `UUID` is mandatory, and it refers to a specific call (i.e., a channel or call leg or session; see [Call Legs](../Introduction/Call-Legs_7143972.mdx#0-about) and [Creating a New Endpoint: Lifecycle of a Session](../Community/Contributing-Code/Creating-New-Modules/9634354.mdx#0-about)).

TODO What does this line mean? "_originate a call directly to park by making an ext the ext part of the originate command &park()_"

**All `sendmsg` commands must be followed by 2 returns.**

Since messaging format is similar to [RFC 2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822), if you are using any libraries that follow the line wrapping recommendation of [RFC 2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822) then make sure that you disable line wrapping as FreeSWITCH will ignore wrapped lines. See ["FreeSWITCH EventSocket header length"](http://blog.godson.in/2010/12/freeswitch-eventsocket-header-length.html) post for more.

  
**Example without a body (note the extra line feed at the end!)**

```xml
sendmsg <uuid>
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: playback
execute-app-arg: /tmp/test.wav


```

#### 3.9.1 Commands

##### 3.9.1.1 `execute`

`execute` is used to invoke dialplan applications, mirroring the function of the `ESLconnection` object's `execute` method (in the [Event Socket Library](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/index.mdx#-new-)).

Check the [XML Dialplan](../Dialplan/XML-Dialplan/index.mdx#why) and [mod\_dptools](./mod_dptools_1970333.mdx#-c) pages for available applications.

  
Force synchronous operations in async mode

If you are using `async` outbound mode, you need to pay attention to potential race conditions, as the commands you send may not execute in sequential order.

You may force the command to wait by setting `event-lock` until the critical or long-running command finishes:

```xml
sendmsg 
call-command: set
execute-app-name: foo=bar\n\n
event-lock:true


```

TODO Is `event-lock` common to all commands? Examples here in [mod\_event\_socket](./mod_event_socket_1048924.mdx#11-acl) and most in [Event Socket Outbound](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/Event-Socket-Outbound_3375460.mdx#faq) are using `sendmsg` with `call-command: execute`, and `setEventLock` in [Event Socket Library](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/index.mdx#-new-) also only mentions `execute`, yet [Event Socket Outbound](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/Event-Socket-Outbound_3375460.mdx#faq) also shows the above snippet. 

TODO Is `call-command: set` still an available command? Taken from [Event Socket Outbound](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/Event-Socket-Library/Event-Socket-Outbound_3375460.mdx#faq), but haven't seen documented anywhere else, and [it is also not listed in the source](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/15ad4c23e259c1c2dff58f89e9124e5f36dd2e94/src/switch%5Fivr.c#L503). Was the intention something like this?

```xml
sendmsg
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: set
execute-app-arg: foo=bar\n\n
event-lock: true
```

The format should be:

**Execute format**

```xml
sendmsg <uuid>
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: <one of the applications>
execute-app-arg: <application data>
loops: <number of times to invoke the command, default: 1>


```

This alternate format can be used for app args that are truncated by the module's 2048 octet limit:

```xml
sendmsg <uuid>
call-command: execute
execute-app-name: <one of the applications>
loops: <number of times to invoke the command, default: 1>
content-type: text/plain
content-length: <content length>

<application data>
```

When an application is executed via `sendmsg`, [CHANNEL\_EXECUTE](../Introduction/Event-System/Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) and [CHANNEL\_EXECUTE\_COMPLETE](../Introduction/Event-System/Event-List_7143557.mdx#nat) events are going to be generated. If you would like to correlate these two events then add an `Event-UUID` header with your custom UUID. In the corresponding events, the UUID will be in the `Application-UUID` header. If you do not specify an `Event-UUID`, Freeswitch will automatically generate a UUID for the `Application-UUID`.

Example:

Event-UUID: 22075ce5-b67b-4f04-a6dd-1726ec14c8bf

##### 3.9.1.2 `hangup`

Hang up the call.

**Format**

```xml
sendmsg <uuid>
call-command: hangup
hangup-cause: <one of the causes listed below>


```

Additional information

* [Hangup Causes](../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Hangup-Cause-Code-Table_3964945.mdx#about)

##### 3.9.1.3 `unicast`

`unicast` is used to hook up [mod\_spandsp](./mod_spandsp_6587021.mdx#--) for faxing over a socket.

**Brian's note**

> That is a nice way for a script or app that uses the socket interface to get at the media. It's good because then spandsp isn't living inside of FreeSWITCH and it can run on a box sitting next to it. It scales better.

  
**unicast example**

```xml
sendmsg <uuid>
call-command: unicast
local-ip: <default is 127.0.0.1>
local-port: <default is 8025>
remote-ip: <default is 127.0.0.1>
remote-port: <default is 8026>
transport: <either "tcp" or "udp", without the quotes>
and optionally
flags: native - don't transcode audio to/from L16
```

##### 3.9.1.4 `nomedia`

No description.

```xml
sendmsg <uuid>
call-command: nomedia
nomedia-uuid: <noinfo>


```

##### `3.9.1.5 xferext`

TODO Document this command.

From [Stéphane Alnet](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/~stephalnet)'s comment:

> The description is missing \`xferext\`, which adds \`application\` to an extension then transfer the channel to that extension (whatever that means! ![(grande sorriso)](/images/icons/emoticons/biggrin.svg) ).

[switch\_ivr.c:503](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/15ad4c23e259c1c2dff58f89e9124e5f36dd2e94/src/switch%5Fivr.c#L503) lists the available commands, and that C file also contains the logic.

**src/switch\_ivr.c**

```cpp
	unsigned long CMD_EXECUTE = switch_hashfunc_default("execute", &hlen);
	unsigned long CMD_HANGUP = switch_hashfunc_default("hangup", &hlen);
	unsigned long CMD_NOMEDIA = switch_hashfunc_default("nomedia", &hlen);
	unsigned long CMD_UNICAST = switch_hashfunc_default("unicast", &hlen);
	unsigned long CMD_XFEREXT = switch_hashfunc_default("xferext", &hlen);
```

### 3.10 exit

```xml
exit
```

Close the socket connection.

### 3.11 auth

```xml
auth <password>
```

### 3.12 log

```xml
log <level>
```

Enable log output, and change the [log level](./mod_console_1048950.mdx#about).

### 3.13 nolog

```xml
nolog
```

Disable log output previously enabled by the log command

### 3.14 nixevent

```xml
nixevent <event types | ALL  | CUSTOM custom event sub-class>
```

Suppress the specified type of event. Useful when you want to allow 'event all' followed by 'nixevent &lt;some\_event>' to see all but 1 type of event.

### 3.15 noevents

```xml
noevents
```

Disable all events that were previously enabled with event.
