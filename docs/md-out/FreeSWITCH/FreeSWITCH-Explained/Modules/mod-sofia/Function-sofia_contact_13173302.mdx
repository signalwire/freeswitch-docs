# Usage

```xml
sofia_contact [profile]/[user](@domain)
```

Profile may be \* for all. @domain is not required if the specified profile doesn't have overlapping users.

You can use this function to trigger, for example, a specific message if the user is not registered or you could fire up some actions to find that user on another switch in a clustered environment.

```xml
sofia_contact profile/user@domain
```

Example:

```xml
sofia_contact internal/820383@sip.foo.com
```

Additional Examples: 

^222 is equivalent to from a request uri to somewhere different:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="${sofia_contact(internal/100@sys.local)}^222" />
<action application="bridge" data="{sip_route_uri=222}${sofia_contact(internal/100@sys.local)}" /> 
```

or, if you want to change the sip from user:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{sip_from_user=222}${sofia_contact(internal/100@sys.local)}" />
```
