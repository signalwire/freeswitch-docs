## Synopsis

```xml
recordFile(filename, <[max_len]>, <[silence_threshold]>, <[silence_secs]>)
```

##   
Arguments

* filename - Full path to filename to write.
* max\_len - maximum length of the recording in seconds.
* silence\_threshold - energy level audio must fall below to be considered silence (500 is a good starting point).
* silence\_secs - seconds of silence to interrupt the record.

## Returns

Will return anything returned by the callback function, or true/false if no callback is used.

**Note**: the file must contain an extension known to FreeSWITCH so it can determine the filetype to write. FreeSWITCH will abort the script if the extension is not provided.

## callback_function

A callback function can be used to process DTMF signals that are pressed during the recording. You can use them to abort the recording.

The callback function must be set by [setDTMFCallback](Py_Session_SetDTMFCallback_13174079.mdx#about) and should return "stop" in order to stop the recording.

## Variables

NOTE: not tested with Python, though they should work.

You can specify a number of variables that will be used when saving the file. The variables must be set by using session.setVariable. The variables that can be set are:

* RECORD\_TITLE
* RECORD\_COPYRIGHT
* RECORD\_SOFTWARE
* RECORD\_ARTIST
* RECORD\_COMMENT
* RECORD\_DATE

## Example

```xml
rtn = session.recordFile("\tmp\recording.wav", 240, 500, 3);
```
