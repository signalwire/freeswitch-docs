# About

Advanced Voice Mail Detection module is designed to detect the single-frequency constant-amplitude tone in audio signal. Common usage is to detect "beep" sound at the end of the voicemail or answering machine greetings (similar to this 1000 Hz [beep](/attachments/1049372/10682567.mp3) \[[raw](/attachments/1049372/10682568.raw)\] shown above, see also "Dialplan examples" below). This is useful in cases where you wish to leave a recorded message on the recipient's message system but don't want to wait for a pause to complete that is common when using [wait\_for\_silence](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Misc.%5FDialplan%5FTools%5Fwait%5Ffor%5Fsilence "Misc. Dialplan Tools wait for silence"), and you are looking for a beep sound to start recording. Avmd may (should) also be used on the outbound calls made by dialer, simultaneously with answering machine detection module (AMD), because the detection of voicemail is strong indication of the call being answered by machine and AMD doesn't detect sounds (though in AMD case you often want to be able to detect machine as soon as possible, more quickly than at the end of the voicemail greetings).

# How it works and how hungry it is

AVMD uses DESA-2 algorithm to separate estimations of instantaneous frequency and amplitude from TKEO energy operator of an audio signal. DESA-2 uses three sample derivative estimation. This algorithm is fast, computationally simple and a little inaccurate in presence of noise, though good enough for almost all practical uses.

AVMD offers three modes of detection, so that it can be used to detect three types of sound:

* detection of constant amplitude
* detection of constant frequency (this may be used to detect dtmf sound)
* detection of constant amplitude and frequency (default)

The call to AVMD's start method results in launching of detection threads processing audio frames with different resolutions and/or offsets. The avmd::start event is fired after successful start of the AVMD session. The FreeSWITCH core then calls AVMD on each incoming audio frame and all detection threads process incoming frame according to their resolution, offset and lag. Once the signal has been qualified as meeting the specified criteria (of constant amplitude, frequency or both) the avmd::beep event is raised. Application should then stop AVMD running on the call which results in avmd::stop event being fired.

  
![](/attachments/1049372/10683540.png)

  
There are known also other energy separation algorithms including bot not limited to DESA-1, variance-covariance method, PRONY, etc. These algorithms differ in a way energy of differentiated signal is estimated and/or in other adjustments. They are more computationally-expensive methods which have been reported to yield better results in terms of robustness and accuracy, at least at some conditions, by some researchers. Therefore it is possible avmd will be extended in the future to implement some of them. At this moment, avmd uses DESA-2 and this results in a single digit percentage error in a production environments.

## Details

This UML diagram depicts processing of audio frames by each of detection threads running in AVMD session, after thread is signaled to start processing by the AVMD main thread in avmd\_process function.![](/download/temp/plantuml8658340724441400981.png)

* multithreaded detectors and lagged detectors
* three modes of detection (amplitude only, frequency only, both simultaneously)
* detection mode setting added to configuration XML
* number of detection threads and the number of lagged detectors settings added to configuration XML
* extended event API (more information about detection session and about it's outcome added to the events)

Compared to call playing simply playback music on answer, running avmd (in default configuration of 36 detectors) consumes about 10 times more CPU. Also there is a tradeoff between detection quality (which increases with number of detection threads) and CPU usage. Please adjust detectors number in AVMD configuration XML or per session to fit your needs and computing resources.

  
## CPU usage (how much CPU it needs)

Tests made on 8-core Intel's i7-4790K CPU indicate that compared to a call simply playing playback music on answer, running avmd (in default configuration of 36 detectors) makes your CPU about 10 times more busy. In a table below we show % of total CPU power used by FreeSWICTH when multiple calls are dialed to extensions, one of them is just playing back the music, other one is running avmd in addition to that.

Results were obtained from output of top command (top -p \`pidof freeswitch\`).

| extension/# of calls  | 10   | 50    | 100  | 150   | 200              |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---------------- |
| playback music        | 1.25 | 3.25  | 6.25 | 7.9   | 9.75             |
| playback music + avmd | 12.9 | 32.13 | 47.8 | 63.75 | 95 (GUI lagging) |

  
# Usage

It is as simple as could only be.

* You "start" the detection on the particular voice channel.
* The avmd::beep indicating that beep has been detected is delivered to your ESL socket listener, to command prompt and written to logs. Avmd also sets the channel variable (see "Channel variables").
* You (optionally) "stop" the detection on the particular voice channel.

  
Therefore you will see output similar to this in the console:

## API interface

This interface is exposed for calls from mod\_event\_socket.

  
## start

Starts avmd detection on a given channel.

  
Usage: &lt;uuid> start

&lt;uuid> - channel unique identifier

Examples:

afcbe4db-cdb3-4e1c-98c5-c12fea8474cc start

  
![](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/c/cb/Warning.png/64px-Warning.png)

In all of this documentation we omit "api avmd" (used in calls from ESL, telnet client), "avmd" (used in calls from fs\_cli, dialplan). It is however assumed that this prefix is always there. In all of this documentation by &lt;x> we mean parameter that is required for a given command and when command is issued the &lt;x> becomes just x. For example, above uuid is channel unique identifier and &lt;uuid> should be understood as "insert uuid of the channel here" (obligatory parameter) when issuing start/stop commands. Extending this example, given the resulting event shown in "Example event" (see below) the following command must have been executed from ESL:

api avmd afcbe4db-cdb3-4e1c-98c5-c12fea8474cc start

or alternatively this form from fs\_cli:

 avmd afcbe4db-cdb3-4e1c-98c5-c12fea8474cc start

## stop

Stops avmd detection on a given channel.

  
Usage: &lt;uuid> stop

&lt;uuid> - channel unique identifier

  
Examples:

afcbe4db-cdb3-4e1c-98c5-c12fea8474cc stop

  
![](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/b/b3/Info.png/64px-Info.png)

All below commands are available since 1.6.8 release.

## show

Prints to console current default/global avmd settings.

  
Usage: show

  
Examples:

show

## reload

Reloads avmd XML configuration settings to what FS has in RAM.

  
Usage: reload

  
Examples:

reload

The settings are loaded from FS memory. This means new data will be a copy of what was loaded to FS from $CONFDIR when it was started or when reloadxml command was called last time. If you change XML file and want avmd to load this, it is enough to call FS command reloadxml. But you can also make avmd to load the XML settings file that was cached by FS when reloadxml was called last time. This avmd's reload method will do it, it always restores settings to what FS has in it's RAM, and what FS has in RAM is the version of XML file corresponding to most recent reloadxml command.

## set

Sets detection on internal/external channel.

  
Usage: set inbound | outbound | default

inbound - set detection on internal channel

outboud - set detection on external channel

default - set avmd settings to default factory settings (see "Dynamic configuration of avmd session")

  
Examples:

set inbound

set outbound

set default

## load

Loads avmd XML settings from RAM and sets detection on internal/external channel.

  
Usage: load inbound | outbound

inbound - set detection on internal channel

outboud - set detection on external channel

  
Examples:

load inbound

load outbound

  
This command is equivalent to reload + set. load inbound == reload + set inbound, load outbound == reload + set outbound.

![](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/b/b3/Info.png/64px-Info.png)

Sometimes you may want to start avmd a few seconds after answer. In that case, once you get an answer event, issue this command

api sched_api +3 none avmd &lt;uuid> start

![](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/b/b3/Info.png/64px-Info.png)

For best results in getting accurate detection as well a saving system resources (CPU & memory), you should do the following:

* Wait until AFTER the call has been answered before starting AVMD. In many cases you may find it best to wait a few seconds after the call is answered before starting AVMD. Starting AVMD before the call is answered will result in waste of CPU resources.
* Once you have received the AVMD event, you should explicitly stop AVMD, even though it will not return more events.

## APP interface

### Commands

This interface is exposed for calls from dialplan and scripts (LUA, js). As from 1.6.8 this version of APP should be used:

When dynamic passing of parameters is used avmd module will validate the comma separated list (which may be empty, that is data="") of key=value pairs for name and value correctness and will set found keys to specified values if validation succeeds. If it doesn't succeed avmd session parameters are set to currently stored default (which means it is set specified in last call to avmd set/ avmd load or otherwise, if none such call has been made - taken from XML config or from default factory settings if config load failed \[there is no config or it is invalid\]). 

  
Below APP calls will be deprecated since 1.6.8 version but they will still work until the next release for not to break the backward compatibility. When you call one of these methods the warning "YOU ARE USING DEPRECATED APP INTERFACE" is printed to the logs.

# Dynamic configuration of avmd session

When avmd session is started it's parameters are configured with values that are currently stored in FreeSWITCH's RAM. These values are taken from avmd XML configuration file avmd\_conf.xml and can be altered by configuration commands (set/load/reload). There is also a possibility to set each parameter of avmd session's individually, per session. It is done by passing comma separated list of parameters and their values with avmd start command from dialplan (as of 1.6.9 version - it is not available from APP interface, e.g. event socket).

To get all avmd events you can subscribe to all FS events and filter them by custom avmd field, a calling command "Call-command":

```cpp
event all
filter Call-command avmd
```

# Channel variables

## avmd_detect

When avmd session starts on a given channel, it's channel variable "avmd\_detect" is set to FALSE. Avmd sets this variable to TRUE just before AVMD\_EVENT\_BEEP is fired, so detection result can be checked by inspecting the value of this variable on a given channel. This is not however the supported way of getting detection indications. You should instead subscribe to and process avmd::beep event or check value of Beep-status field in avmd::stop event. Please take a look at "Start AVMD on the call and check detection result" below for more details.

  
# Scripts

Few useful scripts written in Perl can be found in AVMD source folder (src/mod/applications/mod\_avmd/scripts).

# Configuration

Add avmd module to 'modules.conf':

applications/mod_avmd

Rebuild and install:

```xml
sudo make sure
sudo make install
```

To have FreeSWITCH load it on startup simply add this to '$FS\_ROOT/conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml':

```xml
<load module="mod_avmd"/>
```

# Feedback/questions

![](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/images/thumb/c/cb/Warning.png/64px-Warning.png)

Any voicemail that avmd doesn't detect? Please do let us know by sending an email to FreeSWITCH™ users mailing list - and we will take care of it (please could you prefix the topic with 'mod\_avmd' and address an email to [freeswitch-users@lists.freeswitch.org](mailto:freeswitch-users@lists.freeswitch.org)). However, please do not report bugs to users list - for these please could you use [jira.freeswitch.org](http://jira.freeswitch.org) (see [Reporting Issues to GitHub](../Troubleshooting-Debugging/Reporting-Issues-to-GitHub_5046304.mdx#about)).
