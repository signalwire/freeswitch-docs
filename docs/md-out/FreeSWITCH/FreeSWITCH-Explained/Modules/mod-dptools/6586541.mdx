# About

Applies packet loss concealment and comfort noise generation.cng\_plc performs packet loss concealment on lost packets and execute on originate. It is like execute on answer, etc. but only for outbound calls during originate. Comfort noise is artificially generated noise to assure the caller that the call has not disconnected and is being processed.

# Usage

```xml
<action application="cng_plc"/>
```

# Problem Case

When experiencing intermittent dropped packets, it could be that the packets are probably late and being dropped and replaced with silence.

You can try 2 things:

1. run the app cng\_plc before bridge and in execute\_on\_originate on the B-leg.  
```xml  
<action application="cng_plc"/>  
```
2. enable the jitter buffer at a small value by setting jitterbuffer\_msec=60  
```xml  
<action application="set" data="jitterbuffer_msec=60"/>  
```
