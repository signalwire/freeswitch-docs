# Usage

att\_xfer &lt;channel\_url>

Bridge a third party specified by channel\_url onto the call, speak privately, then bridge original caller to target channel\_url of att\_xfer.

From revision '''14650''', there is new parameter that can be set - ''origination\_cancel\_key''. This feature is used when you want to cancel a transfer and return to the first caller.

after feature request #FS-9734 three new channel variables are added which will allow the feature codes to be configured by a user -

"attxfer\_cancel\_key" - can be used to cancel a tranfer just like origination\_cancel\_key, but straight from the att\_xfer code (deafault '#')

"attxfer\_hangup\_key" - can be used to hangup the call after user wants to end his or her call  (deafault '\*')

"attxfer\_conf\_key" - can be used to initiate a three way transfer (deafault '0')

# Examples

## Example 1

Make a dialplan feature which read the number to make an attended transfer.

```xml
<extension name="att_xfer">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^86$">
    <action application="read" data="3 4 sounds/getdigits.wav attxfer_callthis 30000 #"/>
    <action application="att_xfer" data="sofia/default/${attxfer_callthis}"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

Then bind this feature to DTMF 3.

```xml
<action application="bind_meta_app" data="3 a a execute_extension::86 XML features"/>
```

During call press \*3 to activate the feature. Feed it the number then it will make the call.

1. If you hang up (after the other leg answered and you decided what to do), then it will transfer the call and bridge them together.
2. If the other leg hang up thus indicating it doesn't want the transfer then you get it back.
3. If the other leg is a voicemail or doesn't answered you can hangup that leg by pressing DTMF # (fixed in r14438)
4. If you press DTMF 0 then it will convert it to a three-way, hangup and complete the transfer.

## Example 2

In your dialplan add bind\_meta\_app key that will transfer the call to the extensions that will execute the att\_xfer application.

Example:

```xml
<extension name="local_number">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d{3})$">
    <action application="set" data="dialed_extension=$1"/>
    <action application="export" data="dialed_extension=$1"/>
    <action application="bind_meta_app" data="1 b s execute_extension::attended_xfer XML features"/>
    <action application="set" data="transfer_ringback=$${hold_music}"/>
    <action application="set" data="call_timeout=10"/>
    <action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
    <action application="bridge" data="user/${dialed_extension}@${domain_name}"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

In the features.xml add the extensions attended\_xfer. The extensions below first waits for input from the user (30sec) and then makes attended transfer to the entered extension.

Example:

```xml
<extension name="attended_xfer">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^attended_xfer$">
    <action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>
    <action application="read" data="3 4 ivr/ivr-enter_ext.wav attxfer_callthis 30000 #"/>
    <action application="set" data="attxfer_cancel_key=#"/>
    <action application="set" data="attxfer_hangup_key=*"/>
    <action application="set" data="attxfer_conf_key=0"/>
    <action application="att_xfer" data="user/${attxfer_callthis}@${domain_name}"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

## Example - Using API Call

You can also set channel variables on the command issued via XML-RPC or Event Socket by adding {myvar=myval,myvar1=myval1} e.g

```xml
att_xfer {attxfer_conf_key=3,attxfer_hangup_key=2,attxfer_cancel_key=1}loopback/1000/context
```

| Feature Code | Channel Variable Name | Purpose                                                            | When to use                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | attxfer\_conf\_key    | it will convert the call to three-way conference                   | After the last party answers the call           |
| #            | attxfer_cancel_key  | to hangup the B leg and return you to the caller                   | After the last party answers the call           |
| \*           | attxfer\_hangup\_key  | it will hangup the B leg and bridge A to C (fixed in '''r15013''') | After the last party answers the call           |
| #            | attxfer_cancel_key  | it will cancel the B leg and will return you the caller            | Before the answer of the call by the last party |

## Observations

att\_xfer will not work with loopback channels because the application blocks when bridged to the C leg. If the C leg hangs up, it will bridge back to A. Since loopback hangs up to replace the legs to the correct legs, att\_xfer will detect that and bridge it back to the A leg automatically.
