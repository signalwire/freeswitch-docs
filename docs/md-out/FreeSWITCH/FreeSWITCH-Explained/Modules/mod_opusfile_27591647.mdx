 Created by  Attila Gulyas, last modified by  Dragos Oancea on 2020.02.11

"_Read and Write OGG/Opus files . Some parts inspired from `modshout.c`, `libopusfile`, `libopusenc`_", quoting from [mod\_opusfile.c](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/master/src/mod/formats/mod%5Fopusfile/mod%5Fopusfile.c) . 

If you want to play and record files with extension ".opus" this is the module to use.
