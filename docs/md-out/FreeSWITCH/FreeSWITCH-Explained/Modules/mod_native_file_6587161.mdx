# About

The native file module is designed to make it easy to play sound files where no transcoding is necessary. The default FreeSWITCH sound files are in wav format. Generally, these require transcoding when being played to callers. However, if a native format sound file is available then FreeSWITCH can use it.

This module is useful to play files that are encoded as ulaw, alaw, etc - but only when there is no transcoding path. If unsure use mod\_sndfile which is a generic module to play and record various audio file formats.

## Formats and File Names

File names need to have the proper extensions. Mod\_native\_file uses the IANA [naming conventions](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/audio/). Please be sure to use those extensions. (Case sensitive?)

## Dialplan Examples

When specifying a file to play do not add the file name's extension. FreeSWITCH will pick the correct file.

```xml
 <action application="playback" data="/tmp/hello"/>
```

If you have several files in /tmp then FreeSWITCH will select the appropriate one for the codec in use on the call leg.

```xml
 /tmp/hello.wav
 /tmp/hello.GSM
 /tmp/hello.PCMU
 /tmp/hello.PCMA
 /tmp/hello.G722
 /tmp/hello.G729
 etc...
```

**NOTE:** the file type for the current codec must be present, otherwise you'll receive an error.

## Script to convert a sound file to specific formats to avoid transcoding

**wav2freeswitch-converter.sh** Espandi fonte 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Version : 0.3
#  Author : Mats Karlsson @ Rebtel
#  Date   : 2006-05-09
#  Scoop  : Convert voice prompts from wav format to FreeSWITCH (www.freeswitch.org)
#           native formats (using res_convert in Asterisk).
#           Converts to G.729, G.723, G.711 Alaw/Ulaw, and GSM
#
# Requirements:
#         Asterisk 1.4 or 1.6 with res_convert loaded
#         G.729 codec installed in Asterisk
#         Digium hardware transcoder for G.723
#         sox

* I've created a [script](http://mirror.astlinux.org/sounds/freeswitch/wav2freeswitch-converter.sh) to convert WAV files to various Mod\_native\_file formats using sox and Asterisk. It currently supports GSM, PCMU, PCMA, G729, and G723.
* I've also used it to convert the default FreeSWITCH prompts into the file formats above. Files available [here](http://mirror.astlinux.org/sounds/freeswitch/).
* Use the included fs\_encode program in the bin folder.

```xml
fs_encode -l mod_speex file.wav file.SPEEX
```

```xml
Usage: ./fs_encode [options] input output

The output must end in the format, e.g., myfile.SPEEX
		 -l module[,module]	 Load additional modules (comma-separated)
		 -f format		 fmtp to pass to the codec
		 -p ptime		 ptime to use while encoding
		 -r rate		 sampling rate
		 -b bitrate		 codec bitrate (if supported)
		 -v			 verbose
```
