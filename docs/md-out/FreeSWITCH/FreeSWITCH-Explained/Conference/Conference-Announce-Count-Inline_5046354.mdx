# About

  
This example is a very quick and dirty dialplan and conference config that lets you hear how many callers are in conference.  

# Configuration

First, add this group to your caller-controls in $${conf\_dir}/autoload\_configs/conference.conf.xml:

**conference.conf.xml**

```xml
  <group name="plain">
      <control action="mute" digits="0"/>
      <control action="energy up" digits="9"/>
      <control action="energy equ" digits="8"/>
      <control action="energy dn" digits="7"/>
      <control action="vol talk up" digits="3"/>
      <control action="vol talk zero" digits="2"/>
      <control action="vol talk dn" digits="1"/>
      <control action="vol listen up" digits="6"/>
      <control action="vol listen zero" digits="5"/>
      <control action="vol listen dn" digits="4"/>
      <control action="execute_application" digits="#" data="execute_extension ANNOUNCE_CONF_COUNT_PRIVATE XML default"/>
    </group>
```

Be sure to have your conference profile use the "plain" caller-controls listed above. (Feel free to customize the controls as you see fit or use the bind\_digit\_action method found in the [Conference Add Call Example](./Conference-Add-Call-Example_5046337.mdx#about).)

Next, add this dialplan to $${conf\_dir}/dialplan/default/01\_Announce\_Conf\_Count.xml:

**01\_Announce\_Conf\_Count.xml**

```xml
<include>
  <!-- Sample dialplan for announcing the call count -->
  <extension name="Announce Conf Count (Inline)">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^ANNOUNCE_CONF_COUNT_PRIVATE$">
      <action application="set" data="conf_count=${conference ${conference_name} list count}"/>
      <action application="log" data="INFO ${conf_count}"/>
      <action application="say" data="en number pronounced ${conf_count}"/>
    </condition>
  </extension>
</include>   
```

Call the conference and press **#**. The system will "say" how many callers are in the conference.

Note: You may also execute this announce extension prior to sending the caller into the conference in order to give him a count prior to joining.Make it clear that the number announced excludes the new caller because he hasn't yet joined the conference.
