## FreeSWITCH and Google Talk

One of the reasons I chose to spend time with freeswitch over yate was google talk integration. Was a good choice, I think, for more than just gtalk.

The endpoint that talks to gtalk is mod\_dingaling, and it’s not compiled by default. So to enable it, uncomment #endpoints/mod\_dingaling from modules.conf in your source tree and recompile.

I had to install gnutls-devel to get gtalk working, but check freeswitch.spec for other build packages you might need.

The configuration is pretty straight forward. Make sure in conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml mod\_dingaling is loaded.

I set it up as a client, I think later I might play around with it as a server. My conf/jingle\_profiles/client.xml looks like this:

```xml
<include>
  <!– Client Profile (Original mode) –>
  <profile type="client">
    <param name="name" value="gmail.com"/>
    <param name="login" value="michael.chesterton@gmail.com/gtalk"/>
    <param name="password" value="bellybutton"/>
    <param name="server" value="talk.google.com"/>
    <param name="dialplan" value="XML"/>
    <param name="context" value="public"/>
    <param name="message" value="Press Belly Button to Begin"/>
    <param name="rtp-ip" value="$${bind_server_ip}"/>
    <param name="ext-rtp-ip" value="$${external_rtp_ip}"/>
    <param name="auto-login" value="true"/>
    <!– SASL “plain" or “md5? –>
    <param name="sasl" value="plain"/>
    <!– if the server where the jabber is hosted is not the same as the one in the jid –>
    <!–<param name="server" value="alternate.server.com"/>–>
    <!– Enable TLS or not –>
    <param name="tls" value="true"/>
    <!– disable to trade async for more calls –>
    <param name="use-rtp-timer" value="true"/>
    <!– default extension (if one cannot be determined) –>
    <param name="exten" value="5551212?/>
    <!– VAD choose one –>
    <!– <param name="vad" value="in"/> –>
    <!– <param name="vad" value="out"/> –>
    <param name="vad" value="both"/>
    <!–<param name="avatar" value="/path/to/tiny.jpg"/>–>
  </profile>
</include>
```

  
When editing conf/jingle\_profiles/client.xml, pay attention to the line &lt;profile type="client"> make sure it’s profile , and not x-profile. It comes as x-profile out of the box to stop it from loading. 5551212 is the phone gtalk calls will go to as defined by exten

One other thing is do is add a vcard to your directory entry, I added it to conf/directory/default/1000.xml and directory/default/5551212.xml, mine looks like:

```xml
<include>
  <user id="1000? mailbox="1000?>
    <params>
      <param name="password" value="1234?/>
      <param name="vm-password" value="1234?/>
       <param name="vm-mailto" value="chesty@chesterton.id.au"/>
<!–
       <param name="vm-email-all-messages" value="true"/>
–>
    </params>
    <variables>
      <variable name="user_context" value="default"/>
      <variable name="ruleset" value="internal" />
      <variable name="effective_caller_id_name" value="Michael Chesterton"/>
      <variable name="effective_caller_id_number" value="1000?/>
    </variables>

That will get you signed in to gtalk ready to receive and make calls. Now we need a dialplan to direct gtalk calls to a SIP phone. Part of my conf/dialplan/public.xml looks like:

```xml
<extension name="public_did">
  <condition field="caller_id_number" expression="^([^@]+)" break="never">
    <action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_number=$1?/>
  </condition>
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(5551212)$">
    <action application="set" data="call_timeout=18?/>
    <action application="set" data="continue_on_fail=true"/>
    <action application="set" data="hangup_after_bridge=true"/>
    <action application="bridge" data="sofia/switch.gruntnet/1000,sofia/switch.gruntnet/1001?/>
    <action application="answer"/>
    <action application="voicemail" data="default $${domain} 1000?/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

The first condition field strips out the @ character from the caller id number, my e65 doesn’t like the @ character and rejects the call. Gtalk sets the caller id number as something like [barrang.com@gmail.com](mailto:barrang.com@gmail.com)/Talk.v1047F0FC7A5\. The rest I’ve already talked about here

I’ve only tested setting up a call from an XP vm to my SIP enabled mobile phone, I haven’t tested audio yet. But I’m getting there, I’m waiting for a friend to install gtalk so they can test with me. Then I just need a dialplan entry so I can make gtalk calls from SIP clients.

## FreeSWITCH – Google Talk – Dingaling – Jingle All The Way

I got freeswitch working with google talk. There were a few bugs in mod\_dingaling that were causing segfaults, they’re fixed in the latest update.

I called from gtalk on my XP vm to my e65 via SIP, audio is working. I commented out the line &lt;param name="ext-rtp-ip" value="$${external\_rtp\_ip}"/> from conf/jingle\_profiles/client.xml .

To make calls from the SIP e65 to google talk users, I added to the dialplan conf/dialplan/default.xml

```xml
<extension name="sip2jingle">
 <condition field="source" expression="mod_sofia"/>
 <condition field="destination_number" expression="^gmail\+([^\@]+)\@?(.*)$">
   <action application="bridge" data="dingaling/gmail.com/$1@gmail.com"/>
 </condition>
</extension>
```

Then from the e65 I dial [gmail+user@switch.gruntn](mailto:gmail+user@switch.gruntn)et .

See FreeSWITCH and Google Talk for the rest of the setup.

I still need to do more testing, and understand how it traverses through the NAT firewall before I give out my google talk address to people. Did I mention the I love freeswitch?
